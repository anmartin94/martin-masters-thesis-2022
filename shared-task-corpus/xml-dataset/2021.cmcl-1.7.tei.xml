<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Eye-tracking data from reading represent an important resource for both linguistics and natural language processing. The ability to accurately model gaze features is crucial to advance our understanding of language processing. This paper describes the Shared Task on Eye-Tracking Data Prediction, jointly organized with the eleventh edition of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL 2021). The goal of the task is to predict 5 different token-level eyetracking metrics from the Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo). Eyetracking data were recorded during natural reading of English sentences. In total, we received submissions from 13 registered teams, whose systems include boosting algorithms with handcrafted features, neural models leveraging transformer language models, or hybrid approaches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction/Overview</head><p>The ability of accurately modeling eye-tracking features is crucial to advance the understanding of language processing. Eye-tracking provides millisecond-accurate records on where humans look, shedding lights on where they pay attention during their reading and comprehension phase (see the example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The benefits of utilizing eye movement data have been noticed in various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Not only can it reveal the workings of the underlying cognitive processes of language understanding, but the performance of computational models can also be improved if their inductive bias is adjusted using human cognitive signals such as eye-tracking, fMRI, or EEG</p><p>The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry. data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barrett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hollenstein et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Toneva and Wehbe, 2019)</ref>. Thanks to the recent introduction of a standardized dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hollenstein et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hollenstein et al., , 2020</ref>, it is now possible to compare the capabilities of machine learning approaches to model and analyze human patterns of reading.</p><p>In this shared task, we present the challenge of predicting eye word-level tracking-based metrics recorded during English sentence processing. We encouraged submissions concerning both cognitive modeling and linguistically motivated approaches (e.g., language models). All data files are available on the competition website. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Research on naturalistic reading has shown that fixation patterns are influenced by the predictability of words in their sentence context <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ehrlich and Rayner, 1981)</ref>. In natural language processing and psycholinguistics, the most influential account of the phenomenon is surprisal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hale, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Levy, 2008)</ref>, which claims that the processing difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal, i.e., the negative logarithm of the probabil-ity of the word given the context. Surprisal theory was the reference framework for several studies on language models and eye-tracking data prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Demberg and Keller, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frank and Bod, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fossum and Levy, 2012)</ref>. These studies use the data from the Dundee Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kennedy et al., 2003)</ref>, which consists of sentences from British newspapers with eye-tracking measurements from 10 participants, as one of the earliest and most popular benchmarks.</p><p>Later work on the topic found that the perplexity of a language model is the primary factor determining the fit to human reading times <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goodkind and Bicknell, 2018)</ref>, a result that was confirmed also by the recent investigations involving neural language models such as GRU networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aurnhammer and Frank, 2019)</ref> and Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Merkx and Frank, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wilcox et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hao et al., 2020)</ref>. Using an alternative approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bautista and Naval (2020)</ref> obtained good results for the prediction of eye movements with autoencoders.</p><p>In addition to the ZuCo corpus used for this shared task (see Section 4), there are several other resources of eye-tracking data for English. The Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus (GECO; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cop et al., 2017)</ref> is composed of the entire Agatha Christie's novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles, for a total of 54, 364 tokens, it contains eye-tracking data from 33 subjects, both English native speakers (14) and bilingual speakers of Dutch and English (19), and comes with the Dutch counterpart. The Provo corpus (Luke and Christianson, 2017) contains 55 short English texts about various topics, with 2.5 sentences and 50 words on average, for a total of 2, 689 tokens, and eye-tracking measures collected from 85 subjects. Annotated eye-tracking corpora are also available for other languages, including German <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kliegl et al., 2006)</ref>, Hindi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Husain et al., 2015)</ref>, Japanese <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asahara et al., 2016)</ref> and Russian (Laurinavichyute et al., 2019), among others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task Description</head><p>In this shared task, we present the challenge of predicting eye-tracking-based metrics recorded during English sentence processing. The task is formulated as a regression task to predict the following 5 eye-tracking features for each token in the context of a full sentence:</p><p>1. NFIX (number of fixations): total number of fixations on the current word.    2. FFD (first fixation duration): the duration of the first fixation on the prevailing word.</p><p>3. TRT (total reading time): the sum of all fixation durations on the current word, including regressions.</p><p>4. GPT (go-past time): the sum of all fixations prior to progressing to the right of the current word, including regressions to previous words that originated from the current word.</p><p>5. FIXPROP (fixation proportion): the proportion of participants that fixated the current word (as a proxy for how likely a word is to be fixated).</p><p>The goal of the task is to train a model which predicts these five eye-tracking features for each token in a given sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data</head><p>We use the eye-tracking data recorded during normal reading from the freely available Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hollenstein et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hollenstein et al., , 2020</ref>. ZuCo is a combined eye-tracking and EEG brain activity dataset, which provides anonymized records in compliance with an ethical board approval and as such it does not  contain any information that can be linked to the participants.</p><p>The eye-tracking data was recorded with an Eye-Link 1000 system in a series of naturalistic reading experiments. Full sentences were presented at the same position on the screen one at a time. The participants read each sentence at their own reading speed. The reading material included sentences from movie reviews from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref> and a Wikipedia dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Culotta et al., 2006)</ref>. For a detailed description of the data acquisition, please refer to the original publications. An example sentence is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We use the normal reading paradigms from ZuCo, i.e, Task 1 and Task 2 from ZuCo 1.0, and all tasks from ZuCo 2.0. We extracted the eyetracking data from all 12 subjects from ZuCo 1.0 and all 18 subjects from ZuCo 2.0. The dataset contains 990 sentences. All sentences were shuffled randomly before splitting into training and test sets.</p><p>The training data contains 800 sentences, and the test data 190 sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Preprocessing</head><p>Tokenization The tokens in the sentences are split in the same manner as they were presented to the participants during the reading experiments. Hence, this does not necessarily follow a linguistically correct tokenization. For example, the sequences "(except," and "don't" were presented as such to the reader and not split into "(", "except", "," and "do", "n't" as a tokenizer would do. Sentence endings are marked with an &lt;EOS&gt; symbol added to the last token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Extraction</head><p>The eye-tracking feature values are scaled between 0 and 100 to facilitate evaluation via the mean absolute error. The features NFIX and FIXPROP are scaled separately, while FFD, GPT and TRT are scaled together since these are all dependent and measured in milliseconds. The features are averaged across all readers. The data was scaled and randomly shuffled before splitting into training and test data. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 and 2</ref> show the ranges of the eye-tracking features before and after scaling. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> depicts the feature value distributions in both training and test sets, showing that the distributions are very similar in both splits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we describe the evaluation procedure used to assess the submitted predictions of the participating teams.</p><p>Any additional data source was allowed to train the models, as long as it is freely available to the research community. For example, additional eyetracking corpora, additional features such as brain activity signals, pre-trained language models, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Scoring Metric</head><p>The submitted predictions are evaluated against the real eye-tracking feature values using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric, a measure of errors between paired observations including comparisons of predicted (y) versus observed (x) values for each  word in the test set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M AE = n i=1 |y i − x i | n (1)</formula><p>The winning system is defined as the one with the lowest average MAE across all 5 eye-tracking features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Mean Baseline</head><p>We use the mean central tendency as a baseline for this regression problem, i.e., we calculate the mean value for each feature from the training data and use it as a prediction for all words in the test data.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the MAE scores achieved by this mean baseline for each eye-tracking feature.</p><p>6 Participating Teams &amp; Systems 13 teams and a total of 42 participants registered on the competition website. All 13 teams, including 26 registered participants, submitted their predictions during the evaluation phase. Each team was allowed three submissions during the evaluation phase. Finally, 10 teams published system description papers outlining their approach (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> for all references).</p><p>Methods The participating teams submitted predictions generated from various approaches. Mainly two methods were used: (1) Boosting methods using tree-based algorithms with extensive feature extraction (e.g., CatBoost 2 or LightGBM 3 ), and (2) neural network based approaches for regression such as fine-tuning transformer-based language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Most teams achieved their best performance using an ensemble of predictors. Moreover, some teams also trained hybrid systems including both feature-based approaches and state-of-the-art language models.</p><p>Features The features included for training the systems include surface features (e.g., word length, sentence length, word positions in the sentence), lexical features (e.g., lemmas, named entities) token probability features (word frequency and ngram metrics), syntactic features (e.g., part-ofspeech tags and dependency parsing), text complexity metrics, behavioral measures, (e.g., concreteness, familiarity, age of acquisition), context features (i.e., information about the preceding and following tokens) as well as representations from state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>, and XLNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Additional data Only one team <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Li and Rudzicz, 2021)</ref> used external eye-tracking data, leveraging the Provo corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Luke and Christianson, 2017)</ref> for additional word-level eye movement samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>In this section, we describe the prediction performance achieved by the participating teams. The official results of this shared task are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. The best results were achieved by a linguistic feature-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bestgen, 2021)</ref>. As described above, other teams opted for neural approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Li and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rudzicz, 2021 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Oh, 2021)</ref> or hybrid approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yu et al., 2021 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Choudhary et al., 2021)</ref>, combining linguistic features and state-of-the-art language representations.</p><p>The difficulty of predicting the individual eyetracking features is analogous in all submitted systems. FFD is the most accurately predicted feature. This seems to suggest that the models are more capable to capture early processing stages of lexical access compared to late-stage semantic integration, indexed by TRT and NFIX.</p><p>Generally, the error for the three features representing reading times in milliseconds (FFD, GPT, and TRT), is much lower than for NFIX and FIX-PROP. The latter are the features with the most variance. The mean baseline results also reveal the same patterns. The features with lower variance achieve lower MAEs. The FIXPROP feature, representing how likely a word is to be fixated, might be more challenging to predict since it is more dependent on subject-specific characteristics. Nevertheless, when comparing the MAEs of each eyetracking feature to the mean baseline, the systems achieve the largest improvement on this feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Outlook &amp; Conclusion</head><p>We presented the results of the first shared task on predicting token-level eye-tracking features recorded during natural sentences reading. We hope the CMCL Shared Task makes a lasting contribution to the field of linguistic cognitive modelling by providing researchers with a standard evaluation framework and a high quality dataset. Despite the limited size of the test set, many previously reached conclusions can now be tested more thoroughly and future models can be compared on a shared benchmark.</p><p>For future editions of this shared task, we see the following improvement opportunities: (1) providing an official development set during the training phase; (2) using additional metrics for assessment, such as R 2 to achieve a better understanding of the submitted models; (3) extending the dataset to include additional eye-tracking data from other English corpora, as well as including data from other languages such as Dutch or Russian (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cop et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">or Laurinavichyute et al., 2019</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example sentence from the ZuCo corpus read by a single reader.
