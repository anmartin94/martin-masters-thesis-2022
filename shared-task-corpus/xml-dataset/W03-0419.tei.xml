<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This sentence contains three named entities: Ekeus is a person, U.N. is a organization and Baghdad is a location. Named entity recognition is an important task of information extraction systems. There has been a lot of work on named entity recognition, especially for English (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Borthwick (1999)</ref> for an overview). The Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) have offered developers the opportunity to evaluate systems for English on the same data in a competition. They have also produced a scheme for entity annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chinchor et al., 1999)</ref>. More recently, there have been other system development competitions which dealt with different languages <ref type="bibr">(IREX and CoNLL-2002)</ref>.</p><p>The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns language-independent named entity recognition. We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. The shared task of CoNLL-2002 dealt with named entity recognition for Spanish and Dutch (Tjong Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sang, 2002)</ref>. The participants of the 2003 shared task have been offered training and test data for two other European languages: English and German. They have used the data for developing a named-entity recognition system that includes a machine learning component. The shared task organizers were especially interested in approaches that made use of resources other than the supplied training data, for example gazetteers and unannotated data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data and Evaluation</head><p>In this section we discuss the sources of the data that were used in this shared task, the preprocessing steps we have performed on the data, the format of the data and the method that was used for evaluating the participating systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>The CoNLL-2003 named entity data consists of eight files covering two languages: English and German 1 . For each of the languages there is a training file, a development file, a test file and a large file with unannotated data. The learning methods were trained with the training data. The development data could be used for tuning the parameters of the learning methods. The challenge of this year's shared task was to incorporate the unannotated data in the learning process in one way or another. When the best parameters were found, the method could be trained on the training data and tested on the test data. The results of the different learning methods on the test sets are compared in the evaluation of the shared task. The split between development data and test data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the test data.</p><p>The English data was taken from the Reuters Corpus 2 . This corpus consists of Reuters news stories  between August 1996 and August 1997. For the training and development set, ten days' worth of data were taken from the files representing the end of August 1996. For the test set, the texts were from December 1996. The preprocessed raw data covers the month of September 1996.</p><p>The text for the German data was taken from the ECI Multilingual Text Corpus 3 . This corpus consists of texts in many languages. The portion of data that was used for this task, was extracted from the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundshau. All three of the training, development and test sets were taken from articles written in one week at the end of August 1992. The raw data were taken from the months of September to December 1992.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> contains an overview of the sizes of the data files. The unannotated data contain 17 million tokens (English) and 14 million tokens (German).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data preprocessing</head><p>The participants were given access to the corpus after some linguistic preprocessing had been done: for all data, a tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, and a chunker were applied to the raw data. We created two basic language-specific tokenizers for this shared task. The English data was tagged and chunked by the memory-based MBT tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daelemans et al., 2002)</ref>. The German data was lemmatized, tagged and chunked by the decision tree tagger Treetagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Schmid, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Named entity tagging of English and German training, development, and test data, was done by hand at the University of Antwerp. Mostly, MUC conventions were followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chinchor et al., 1999</ref>). An extra named entity category called MISC was added to denote all names which are not already in the other categories. This includes adjectives, like Italian, and events, like 1000 Lakes Rally, making it a very diverse category.  <ref type="bibr">(1995)</ref>. We assume that named entities are non-recursive and non-overlapping. When a named entity is embedded in another named entity, usually only the top level entity has been annotated. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> contains an overview of the number of named entities in each data file.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Evaluation</head><p>The performance in this task is measured with F β=1 rate:   <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Van Rijsbergen, 1975)</ref>. Precision is the percentage of named entities found by the learning system that are correct. Recall is the percentage of named entities present in the corpus that are found by the system. A named entity is correct only if it is an exact match of the corresponding entity in the data file.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F β = (β 2 + 1) * precision * recall (β 2 * precision + recall)<label>(1</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Participating Systems</head><p>Sixteen systems have participated in the CoNLL-2003 shared task. They employed a wide variety of machine learning techniques as well as system combination. Most of the participants have attempted to use information other than the available training data. This information included gazetteers and unannotated data, and there was one participant who used the output of externally trained named entity recognition systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Learning techniques</head><p>The most frequently applied technique in the CoNLL-2003 shared task is the Maximum Entropy Model. Five systems used this statistical learning method. Three systems used Maximum Entropy Models in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bender et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chieu and Ng, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Curran and Clark, 2003)</ref>. Two more systems used them in combination with other techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al., 2003)</ref>. Maximum Entropy Models seem to be a good choice for this kind of task: the top three results for English and the top two results for German were obtained by participants who employed them in one way or another.</p><p>Hidden Markov Models were employed by four of the systems that took part in the shared task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mayfield et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003)</ref>. However, they were always used in combination with other learning techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al. (2003)</ref> also applied the related Conditional Markov Models for combining classifiers.</p><p>Learning methods that were based on connectionist approaches were applied by four systems. Zhang and Johnson (2003) used robust risk minimization, which is a Winnow technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al. (2003)</ref> employed the same technique in a combination of learners. Voted perceptrons were applied to the shared task data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carreras et al. (2003a)</ref> and Hammerton used a recurrent neural network (Long Short-Term Memory) for finding named entities.</p><p>Other learning approaches were employed less frequently. Two teams used AdaBoost.MH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carreras et al., 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2003)</ref> and two other groups employed memory-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Meulder and Daelemans, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003)</ref>. Transformation-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003)</ref>, Support Vector Machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mayfield et al., 2003)</ref> and Conditional Random Fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(McCallum and Li, 2003)</ref> were applied by one system each.</p><p>Combination of different learning systems has proven to be a good method for obtaining excellent results. Five participating groups have applied system combination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al. (2003)</ref> tested different methods for combining the results of four systems and found that robust risk minimization worked best. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al. (2003)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Features</head><p>The choice of the learning approach is important for obtaining a good system for recognizing named entities. However, in the CoNLL-2002 shared task we found out that choice of features is at least as important. An overview of some of the types of features chosen by the shared task participants, can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>.</p><p>All participants used lexical features (words) except for Whitelaw and Patrick ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) who implemented a character-based method. Most of the systems employed part-of-speech tags and two of them have recomputed the English tags with better taggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2003)</ref>. Othographic information, affixes, gazetteers and chunk information were also incorporated in most systems although one group reports that the available chunking information did not help <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2003)</ref> Other features were used less frequently. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> does not reveal a single feature that would be ideal for named entity recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">External resources</head><p>Eleven of the sixteen participating teams have attempted to use information other than the training data that was supplied for this shared task. All included gazetteers in their systems. Four groups examined the usability of unannotated data, either for extracting training instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bender et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003)</ref> or obtaining extra named entities for gazetteers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Meulder and Daelemans, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McCallum and Li, 2003)</ref>. A reasonable number of groups have also employed unannotated data for obtaining capitalization features for words. One participating team has used externally trained named entity recognition systems for English as a part in a combined system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003)</ref>.  with extra information compared to while using only the available training data. The inclusion of extra named entity recognition systems seems to have worked well <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003)</ref>. Generally the systems that only used gazetteers seem to gain more than systems that have used unannotated data for other purposes than obtaining capitalization information. However, the gain differences between the two approaches are most obvious for English for which better gazetteers are available. With the exception of the result of Zhang and Johnson (2003), there is not much difference in the German results between the gains obtained by using gazetteers and those obtained by using unannotated data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Performances</head><p>A baseline rate was computed for the English and the German test sets. It was produced by a system which only identified entities which had a unique class in the training data. If a phrase was part of more than one entity, the system would select the longest one.</p><p>All systems that participated in the shared task have outperformed the baseline system. For all the F β=1 rates we have estimated significance boundaries by using bootstrap resampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Noreen, 1989)</ref>. From each output file of a system, 250 random samples of sentences have been chosen and the distribution of the F β=1 rates in these samples is assumed to be the distribution of the performance of the system. We assume that performance A is significantly different from performance B if A is not within the center 90% of the distribution of B.</p><p>The performances of the sixteen systems on the two test data sets can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>. For English, the combined classifier of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al. (2003)</ref> achieved the highest overall F β=1 rate. However, the difference between their performance and that of the Maximum Entropy approach of Chieu and Ng ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) is not significant. An important feature of the best system that other participants did not use, was the inclusion of the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers in the combination process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al. (2003)</ref> have also obtained the highest F β=1 rate for the German data. Here there is no significant difference between them and the systems of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zhang and Johnson (2003)</ref>.</p><p>We have combined the results of the sixteen system in order to see if there was room for improvement. We converted the output of the systems to the same IOB tagging representation and searched for the set of systems from which the best tags for the development data could be obtained with majority voting. The optimal set of systems was determined by performing a bidirectional hill-climbing search <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Caruana and Freitag, 1994)</ref> with beam size 9, starting from zero features. A majority vote of five systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chieu and Ng, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Florian et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McCallum and Li, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003)</ref> performed best on the English development data. Another combination of five systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carreras et al., 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mayfield et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McCallum and Li, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Munro et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang and Johnson, 2003)</ref> obtained the best result for the German development data. We have performed a majority vote with these sets of systems on the related test sets and obtained F β=1 rates of 90.30 for English (14% error reduction compared with the best system) and 74.17 for German (6% error reduction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We have described the CoNLL-2003 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition. Sixteen systems have processed English and German named entity data. The best performance for both languages has been obtained by a combined learning system that used Maximum Entropy Models, transformation-based learning, Hidden Markov Models as well as robust risk minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Florian et al., 2003)</ref>. Apart from the training data, this system also employed gazetteers and the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers. The performance of the system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chieu et al. (2003)</ref> was not significantly different from the best performance for English and the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al.
