<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hope plays a crucial role in the well-being, recuperation and restoration of human life. Hope speech reflects the belief that one can discover pathways to their desired objectives and become motivated to utilise those pathways. We created a hope speech detection dataset to encourage research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) towards reinforcement of positivity rather than minimising negativity (through control of hate speech etc.). In this paper, we report the findings of the shared task of hope speech detection for Tamil, English, and Malayalam languages conducted as a part of the EACL 2021 workshop on Language Technology for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (LT-EDI-2021). We also present an overview of the methods and results of the competing systems. The datasets for this challenge are openly available 1 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared task to conduct hope speech detection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of studies focusing on the detection and management of hate speech and offensive language in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kumar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mandl et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zampieri et al., 2020)</ref>. However, this has led to controlling user expression instead of improving user experience. <ref type="bibr">(Ghanghor et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hegde et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yasaswini et al., 2021)</ref>. This has also resulted in putting barriers on modes of expression of different groups of people resulting in the violation of the principles of Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). For instance, some NLP systems have classified the comments made in African American English as offensive language without accommodating the linguistic features peculiar to the dialect. Hence there is a need for a shift in the approaches taken to handle hate speech without compromising on the principles of EDI.</p><p>We propose to shift the prevailing research direction in Natural Language Processing from controlling negativity (curbing hate speech etc.) to encouraging positivity (promoting hope speech). Hope speech is any expression that is positive, encouraging, supportive, and / or inspires promise of the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chakravarthi, 2020a)</ref>. For the shared task organised in this connection, participants were provided with development, training and test dataset in English as well as in two under-resourced languages -Tamil and Malayalam. Tamil (ISO 639-3: tam) belongs to the Dravidian language family and is widely spoken in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Krishnamurti, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kolipakam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chakravarthi, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mahesan, 2019, 2020a,b)</ref>. Malayalam (ISO 639-3: mal) also belongs to the Dravidian language family and is spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the Union Territories of <ref type="bibr">Lakshdweep and Puducherry (Chakravarthi et al., 2020)</ref>. Both Tamil and Malayalam have their own scripts which are alphasyllabaries like other Indic scripts i.e. they are partially alphabetic and partially syllabic. The Tamil language was written using Tamili, Vattezhuthu, Chola, Pallava and Chola-Pallava scripts at different points in history. The modern Tamil script descended from the Chola-Pallava script that was conceived around the 6th century CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Srinivasan, 2019)</ref>. Malayalam was first written with Vattezhuthu script that evolved from Tamili script around 4-5th century CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mahadevan, 2003)</ref>. Modern Malayalam is written using the Vattezhuttu alphabets extended with symbols from the Grantha script to accomodate non-native Sanskrit sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Krishnamurti, 2003)</ref>. Although they have their own scripts, the social media comments in these languages are often written in Latin script as it is easy to input.</p><p>Our dataset for the hope speech for EDI shared task was created from user-generated content in <ref type="bibr">Tamil, Malayalam, and English (Chakravarthi and Muralidaran, 2021)</ref>. The user-generated comments in our dataset for Tamil and Malayalam were codemixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chakravarthi, 2020a)</ref>. We proposed a comment/post level classification task. The goal for the participants was to classify a given Youtube comment into either 'Hope speech', 'Non hope speech' or 'Not Tamil / Not Malayalam / Not English'. Our CodaLab website will remain open to allow researchers to access the data and build upon this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task Description</head><p>We define the hope speech for our problem as "YouTube comments/posts that offer support, reassurance, suggestions, inspiration and insight". A comment/post within the corpus may contain more than one sentence, but the average sentence length of the corpus is one. The annotations in the corpus are made at a comment/post level. The participants were provided with development, training and test dataset in English, Tamil, and Malayalam. A few examples from the dataset are given below along with their translations and hope speech class annotations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Datasets</head><p>We have used the HopeEDI datasets from Chakravarthi (2020a) for this shared task. Our dataset contained user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with <ref type="bibr">28,451, 20,198 and 10,705</ref> comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as hope speech or not. The inter-annotator agreement of the dataset labels was verified using Krippendorff's alpha. We will now briefly describe the annotation process and the statistics of the collected dataset. For detailed explanation of the datasets, please refer to the works of Chakravarthi (2020a). The data was collected on a wide range of socially relevant topics related to EDI, including LGBTIQ issues, COVID-19, women in STEM, Black Lives Matter, Dravidian languages, and the Indo-China war.</p><p>The data for English was collected from Englishspeaking regions across the world. For Tamil and Malayalam, we collected the data from the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in India. Full consideration was given to minimize the risk associated with breach of privacy by removing the information related to individual identity from a comment before it was sent for annotation. The annotators were educated about EDI and a minimum of three annotators labelled each comment. Our diverse annotator base was from Australia, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Tamil Nadu, Kerala (in India) and Sri Lanka. The inter-annotator agreement in terms of Krippendorff's alpha (Î±) was 0.63, 0.76, anad 0.85 for English, Tamil and Malayalam.</p><p>In total, HopeEDI dataset contains 59,354 comments with <ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">451 comments in English,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">198 comments in Tamil,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 10,</ref><ref type="bibr">705 comments in Malayalam. Table</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> show the distribution of HopeEDI dataset by language and annotation label respectively. To calculate corpus statistics nltk tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bird et al., 2009)</ref> was used to tokenise the sentences in the comments. The vocabulary size of the Tamil and Malayalam dataset was high due to different types of code-mixing in the user-generated content.</p><p>Most of the comments fell under the 'Not hope' category because of how we defined hope speech and hence the distribution of classes in the dataset was skewed. It is typical for user-generated content from online social media platforms to be skewed and the systems should be able to handle imbalanced data common in real-life setting. 'not Tamil' and 'not Malayalam' labels are found in considerably large amount due to high code-mixing. The fully annotated dataset was split into training, de-     <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Training Phase</head><p>In this first phase, training, validation and development data were released for the participants to train and develop hope speech detection for one or more of the three languages. The participants could choose to perform cross-validation on the training data or use the validation dataset for preliminary evaluations and use the development set for hyperparameter sharing. The goal of this phase was to ensure that the systems developed by the participants be ready for evaluation before the release of the test data. In total, 137 participants registered for all the three languages and downloaded the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Testing Phase</head><p>In this phase, the test dataset was released in Co-daLab without the gold labels. Participants were instructed to submit their predictions using Google Forms. They were allowed to submit their results as many times as they wanted to and their best submission was chosen for evaluation and preparation of rank list. The predictions were evaluated against the gold standard labels. The performance of the classification system was measured in terms of weighted averaged Precision, Recall and F-Score across all the classes. Weighted averaged scores calculate the support-weighted mean per label. The metric used for the preparing the rank list was the weighted F1 score. Participants were encouraged to check their system with Sklearn classification report 2 . For Tamil, Malayalam and English languages, the number of participants were 30, 31 and 31 respectively for the final test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Systems</head><p>We first describe the baseline systems from the HopeEDI paper. Next, we briefly describe the general approach taken by each participating team. We encourage the readers to refer to the individual papers of each team for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline Classifiers</head><p>We used the prior published work as the baseline for hope speech detection from social media. More details about the baseline system description and results can be seen in Chakravarthi (2020a). In this prior work, we described in detail our dataset and presented our baseline results by employing a wide range of standard classifiers on the unbalanced settings of the dataset. The experiment was applied on the token frequency-inverse document frequency (Tf-Idf) of tokens. We used sklearn 3 library to create baseline classifiers. We used a grid search for the k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and logistic regression. For the multinomial Naive Bayes, we set alpha = 0.7. More details about the parameters of the classifier will be published in the code.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussion</head><p>Overall, we received a total of 31,31 and 30 submissions for English, Malayalam and Tamil tasks. It is interesting to note that the top performing teams in all the three languages predominantly used XLM-Roberta to complete the shared task. One of the top ranking teams for English used context-aware string embeddings for word representations and Recurrent Neural Networks and pooled document embeddings for text representation. Among the other submissions, although Bi-LSTM was popular, there were other machine learning and deep learning models that were used. However, they did not achieve good results compared to the Roberta based models. The top scores were 0.61, 0.85 and 0.93 for Tamil, Malayalam and English respectively. The range of scores was between 0.37 to 0.61, 0.49 to 0.85 and 0.61 to 0.93 for Tamil, Malayalam and English datasets respectively. It can be seen that the F1 scores of all the submissions on the Tamil dataset were considerably lower than those of Malayalam and English. It is not suprising that the English scores were better because many approaches used variations of pretrained transformer based models trained on English data. Due to codemixing at various levels the scores are naturally lower for Malayalam and Tamil datasets. Among these two, the systems submitted performed badly on Tamil data. The identification of the exact reasons for the bad performance in Tamil requires further research. However, one possible explanation for this could be that the distribution of 'Hope speech', 'Non hope speech' and 'not-Tamil' classes is starkly different from those of English and Malayalam. In the English dataset there were just 27 out of 28,451 comments which were labelled as not-English by the annotators. In the remaining two classes, the number of non-hope speech comments were significantly higher than hope speech comments. Similarly in Malayalam there were only 888 out of 10,705 comments that were not Malayalam and overwhelmingly higher proportion of non-hope speech in the dataset. However in Tamil dataset, there were 2,483 comments out of 20,198 comments that were not Tamil. Moreover the proportion of Non-hope speech comments in Tamil (9,816 comments) is close enough to the number of hope speech labels <ref type="bibr">(7,899 comments)</ref>. This made the classifications in English and Malayalam a binary prediction task rather than a three class classification and naturally the former systems performed better than the latter.</p><p>The participants rarely faced challenges during the training, testing and submission phase. However, there were minor inconsistencies in the labelling of classes that was duly rectified on Codalab immediately. The intial round of peer review offered significant suggestions to the participants in terms of rewriting paper in a more presentable way. These suggestions of the reviewers were duly incorporated before the final submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented the first shared task results on hope speech detection for equality, diversity, and inclusion.
