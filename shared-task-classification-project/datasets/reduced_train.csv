3	219	219	S01-english-allwords	abstract	1	2	4.0	1.0	We describe our experience in preparing the lexicon and sense-tagged corpora used in the English all-words and lexical sample tasks of SENSEVAL-2.	0
4	544	544	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	In SENSEVAL-2, there are two Japanese tasks, a translation task and a dictionary task.	0
5	545	545	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	This paper describes the details of the dictionary task.	0

7	547	547	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	4	11	2.0	1.0	This task is a lexical sample task.	0
8	548	548	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	5	12	2.0	1.0	Word senses were defined according to the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten (Nishio et aL, 1994), a Japanese dictionary published by Iwanami Shoten.	0
9	549	549	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	6	13	2.0	1.0	It was distributed to all participants as a sense inventory.	0
10	550	550	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	7	14	2.0	1.0	Training data, a corpus consisting of 3,000 newspaper articles and manually annotated with sense IDs, was also distributed to participants.	0
11	551	551	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	8	15	3.0	1.0	For evaluation, we distributed newspaper articles with marked target words as test documents.	0
12	552	552	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	9	16	3.0	1.0	Participants were required to assign one or more sense IDs to each target word, optionally with associated probabilities.	1
13	553	553	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	10	17	3.0	1.0	The number of target words was 100, 50 nouns and 50 verbs.	0
14	554	554	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	11	18	3.0	1.0	One hundred instances of each target word were provided, making for a total of 10,000 instances.	0
15	555	555	S01-japanese-dictionary	Introduction	12	19	4.0	1.0	In what follows, Section 2 describes details of data used in the Japanese dictionary task.	0

19	664	664	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	In written texts, words which have multiple senses can be classified into two categories; homonyms and polysemous words.	0
20	665	665	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	Generally speaking, while homonymy sense distinction is quite clear, polysemy sense distinction is very subtle and hard.	0
21	666	666	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	English texts contain many homonyms.	0
22	667	667	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	4	11	2.0	1.0	On the other hand, Japanese texts in which most content words are written by ideograms rarely contain homonyms.	0
23	668	668	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	5	12	2.0	1.0	That is, the main target in Japanese WSD is polysemy, which makes Japanese WSD task setup very hard.	0
24	669	669	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	6	13	2.0	1.0	What sense distinction of polysemous words is reasonable and effective heavily depends on how to use it, that is, an application ofWSD.	0
25	670	670	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	7	14	2.0	1.0	Considering such a situation, in addition to the ordinary dictionary task we organized another task for Japanese, a translation task, in which word sense is defined according to translation distinction.	0
26	671	671	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	8	15	3.0	1.0	Here, we set up the task assuming the example-based machine translation paradigm (Nagao, 1981).	0
27	672	672	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	9	16	3.0	1.0	That is, first, a translation memory (TM) is constructed which contains, for each Japanese head word, a list of typical Japanese expressions (phrases/sentences) involving the head word and an English translation for each (Figure 1).	0
28	673	673	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	10	17	3.0	1.0	We call a pair of Japanese and English expressions in the TM as a TM record.	0
29	674	674	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	11	18	3.0	1.0	Given an evaluation document containing a target word, participants have to submit the TM record best approximating that usage.	1
30	675	675	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	12	19	4.0	1.0	Alternatively, submissions can take the form of actual target word translations, or translations of phrases or sentences including each target word.	0
31	676	676	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	13	20	4.0	1.0	This allows existing rule-based machine translation (MT) systems to participate in the task, and we can compare TM based systems with existing MT systems.	0
32	677	677	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	14	21	4.0	1.0	For evaluation, we distributed newspaper articles.	0
33	678	678	S01-japanese-translation	Introduction	15	22	4.0	2.0	The number of target words was 40, and 30 instances of each target word were provided, making for a total of 1,200 instances.	0

59	1370	1370	S04-italian-allwords	Introduction	6	9	4.0	1.0	Problems connected with i) the high granularity of sense distinctions in the lexical resource and ii) unsolvable ambiguities of the contexts are dealt with.	0
60	1371	1371	S04-italian-allwords	Introduction	7	10	4.0	1.0	Finally, it is evidenced how the annotation exercise can be of help in updating or tuning IWN, by adding missing senses and/or entries.	0
61	1455	1455	S04-logic-form-id	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	The goal of a Logic Form Identification (LFi) task is to evaluate the performance of different methods addressing the issue of LFi.	0
62	1456	1456	S04-logic-form-id	Introduction	2	8	2.0	1.0	The Logic Form (LF) that we use is a flat, scope-free first order logic representation that embeds lexical and syntactic information.	0

238	2949	2949	S07-10	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	Participating systems are free to use any lexical resource.	0
239	2950	2950	S07-10	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	There is a subtask which requires identifying cases where the word is functioning as part of a multiword in the sentence and detecting what that multiword is.	0
240	3076	3076	S07-11	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	As part of the SemEval-2007 evaluation exercise, we organized an English lexical sample task for word sense disambiguation (WSD), where the senseannotated examples were semi-automatically gathered from word-aligned English-Chinese parallel texts.	1
241	3077	3077	S07-11	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	Two tracks were organized for this task, each gathering data from a different corpus.	0
242	3078	3078	S07-11	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	In this paper, we describe our motivation for organizing the task, our task framework, and the results of participants.	0
243	3079	3079	S07-11	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	Past research has shown that supervised learning is one of the most successful approaches to WSD.	0
244	3080	3080	S07-11	Introduction	5	10	1.0	1.0	However, this approach involves the collection of a large text corpus in which each ambiguous word has been annotated with the correct sense to serve as training data.	0
245	3081	3081	S07-11	Introduction	6	11	2.0	1.0	Due to the expensive annotation process, only a handful of manually sense-tagged corpora are available.	0
246	3082	3082	S07-11	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	An effort to alleviate the training data bottleneck is the Open Mind Word Expert (OMWE) project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) to collect sense-tagged data from Internet users.	0
247	3083	3083	S07-11	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	Data gathered through the OMWE project were used in the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task.	0
248	3084	3084	S07-11	Introduction	9	14	2.0	1.0	In that task, WordNet-1.7.1 was used as the sense inventory for nouns and adjectives, while Wordsmyth 1 was used as the sense inventory for verbs.	0
249	3085	3085	S07-11	Introduction	10	15	2.0	1.0	Another source of potential training data is parallel texts.	0
250	3086	3086	S07-11	Introduction	11	16	3.0	1.0	Our past research in (Ng et al., 2003;	0
251	3087	3087	S07-11	Introduction	12	17	3.0	1.0	Chan and Ng, 2005) has shown that examples gathered from parallel texts are useful for WSD.	0
252	3088	3088	S07-11	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	"Briefly, after manually assigning appropriate Chinese translations to each sense of an English word, the English side of a word-aligned parallel text can then serve as the training data, as they are considered to have been disambiguated and ""sense-tagged"" by the appropriate Chinese translations."	0
253	3089	3089	S07-11	Introduction	14	19	3.0	2.0	Using the above approach, we gathered the training and test examples for our task from parallel texts.	0
254	3090	3090	S07-11	Introduction	15	20	3.0	2.0	Note that our examples are collected without manually annotating each individual ambiguous word occurrence, allowing us to gather our examples in a much shorter time.	0
255	3091	3091	S07-11	Introduction	16	21	4.0	2.0	This contrasts with the setting of the English lexical sample task in previous SENSE-VAL evaluations.	0
256	3092	3092	S07-11	Introduction	17	22	4.0	2.0	In the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2, the sense tagged data were created through manual annotation by trained lexicographers.	0
257	3093	3093	S07-11	Introduction	18	23	4.0	2.0	In SENSEVAL-3, the data were gathered through manual sense annotation by Internet users.	0
258	3094	3094	S07-11	Introduction	19	24	4.0	2.0	In the next section, we describe in more detail the process of gathering examples from parallel texts and the two different parallel corpora we used.	0
259	3095	3095	S07-11	Introduction	20	25	4.0	2.0	We then give a brief description of each of the partici-pating systems.	0
260	3096	3096	S07-11	Introduction	21	26	4.0	2.0	In Section 4, we present the results obtained by the participants, before concluding in Section 5.	0
261	3267	3267	S07-13	Introduction	1	4	1.0	1.0	Finding information about people in the World Wide Web is one of the most common activities of Internet users.	0
262	3268	3268	S07-13	Introduction	2	5	1.0	1.0	Person names, however, are highly ambiguous.	0
263	3269	3269	S07-13	Introduction	3	6	1.0	1.0	In most cases, the results for a person name search are a mix of pages about different people sharing the same name.	0
264	3270	3270	S07-13	Introduction	4	7	1.0	1.0	The user is then forced either to add terms to the query (probably losing recall and focusing on one single aspect of the person), or to browse every document in order to filter the information about the person he is actually looking for.	0
265	3271	3271	S07-13	Introduction	5	8	1.0	1.0	In an ideal system the user would simply type a person name, and receive search results clustered according to the different people sharing that name.	0
266	3272	3272	S07-13	Introduction	6	9	2.0	1.0	And this is, in essence, the WePS (Web People Search) task we have proposed to SemEval-2007 participants: systems receive a set of web pages (which are the result of a web search for a person name), and they have to cluster them in as many sets as entities sharing the name.	1
267	3273	3273	S07-13	Introduction	7	10	2.0	1.0	This task has close links with Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which is generally formulated as the task of deciding which sense a word has in a given con-text.	0
268	3274	3274	S07-13	Introduction	8	11	2.0	1.0	In both cases, the problem addressed is the resolution of the ambiguity in a natural language expression.	0
269	3275	3275	S07-13	Introduction	9	12	2.0	1.0	A couple of differences make our problem different.	0
270	3276	3276	S07-13	Introduction	10	13	2.0	1.0	WSD is usually focused on openclass words (common nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs).	0
271	3277	3277	S07-13	Introduction	11	14	2.0	1.0	The first difference is that boundaries between word senses in a dictionary are often subtle or even conflicting, making binary decisions harder and sometimes even useless depending on the application.	0
272	3278	3278	S07-13	Introduction	12	15	3.0	1.0	In contrast, distinctions between people should be easier to establish.	0
273	3279	3279	S07-13	Introduction	13	16	3.0	1.0	The second difference is that WSD usually operates with a dictionary containing a relatively small number of senses that can be assigned to each word.	0
274	3280	3280	S07-13	Introduction	14	17	3.0	1.0	"Our task is rather a case of Word Sense Discrimination, because the number of ""senses"" (actual people) is unknown a priori, and it is in average much higher than in the WSD task (there are 90,000 different names shared by 100 million people according to the U.S. Census Bureau)."	0
275	3281	3281	S07-13	Introduction	15	18	3.0	1.0	There is also a strong relation of our proposed task with the Co-reference Resolution problem, focused on linking mentions (including pronouns) in a text.	0
276	3282	3282	S07-13	Introduction	16	19	3.0	1.0	Our task can be seen as a co-reference resolution problem where the focus is on solving interdocument co-reference, disregarding the linking of all the mentions of an entity inside each document.	0
277	3283	3283	S07-13	Introduction	17	20	3.0	1.0	"An early work in name disambiguation (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) uses the similarity between documents in a Vector Space using a ""bag of words"" representation."	0

287	3512	3512	S07-15	abstract	2	3	3.0	1.0	It avoids the pitfalls of evaluating a graph of inter-related labels by defining three sub tasks that allow pairwise evaluation of temporal relations.	0
288	3513	3513	S07-15	abstract	3	4	4.0	1.0	The task not only allows straightforward evaluation, it also avoids the complexities of full temporal parsing.	0
289	3660	3660	S07-16	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	This task tries to establish the relative quality of available semantic resources (derived by manual or automatic means).	0
290	3661	3661	S07-16	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The quality of each large-scale knowledge resource is indirectly evaluated on a Word Sense Disambiguation task.	1
291	3662	3662	S07-16	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	In particular, we use Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007 English Lexical Sample tasks as evaluation bechmarks to evaluate the relative quality of each resource.	0
292	3663	3663	S07-16	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	Furthermore, trying to be as neutral as possible with respect the knowledge bases studied, we apply systematically the same disambiguation method to all the resources.	0
293	3664	3664	S07-16	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	A completely different behaviour is observed on both lexical data sets (Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007).	0
294	3792	3792	S07-17	Introduction	1	4	2.0	1.0	Correctly disambiguating words (WSD), and correctly identifying the semantic relationships between those words (SRL), is an important step for building successful natural language processing applications, such as text summarization, question answering, and machine translation.	1
295	3793	3793	S07-17	Introduction	2	5	3.0	1.0	SemEval-2007 Task-17 (English Lexical Sample, SRL and All-Words) focuses on both of these challenges, WSD and SRL, using annotated English text taken from the Wall Street Journal and the Brown Corpus.	0

363	5003	5003	S10-9	Task Description	10	41	4.0	2.0	At test time, given a noun compound and a list of paraphrasing verbs, a participating system needs to produce aptness scores that correlate well (in terms of relative ranking) with the held out human judgments.	1
364	5004	5004	S10-9	Task Description	11	42	4.0	2.0	There may be a diverse range of paraphrases for a given compound, some of them in fact might be inappropriate, but it can be expected that the distribution over paraphrases estimated from a large number of subjects will indeed be representative of the compound's meaning.	0

367	5087	5087	S10-10	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	While semantic role labeling is traditionally viewed as a sentence-internal task, local semantic argument structures clearly interact with each other in a larger context, e.g., by sharing references to specific discourse entities or events.	0
368	5088	5088	S10-10	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	In the shared task we looked at one particular aspect of cross-sentence links between argument structures, namely linking locally uninstantiated roles to their co-referents in the wider discourse context (if such co-referents exist).	1

403	5652	5652	S10-15	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	There are seven cases of grapheme to phoneme in a text to speech system (Yarowsky, 1997).	0
404	5653	5653	S10-15	abstract	3	4	1.0	1.0	Among them, the most difficult task is disambiguating the homograph word, which has the same POS but different pronunciation.	1
405	5654	5654	S10-15	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	In this case, different pronunciations of the same word always correspond to different word senses.	0
406	5655	5655	S10-15	abstract	5	6	2.0	1.0	Once the word senses are disambiguated, the problem of GTP is resolved.	0
407	5656	5656	S10-15	abstract	6	7	2.0	2.0	There is a little different from traditional WSD, in this task two or more senses may correspond to one pronunciation.	0
408	5657	5657	S10-15	abstract	7	8	2.0	2.0	That is, the sense granularity is coarser than WSD.	0
409	5658	5658	S10-15	abstract	8	9	3.0	2.0	"For example, the preposition ""为"" has three senses: sense1 and sense2 have the same pronunciation {wei 4}, while sense3 corresponds to {wei 2}."	0
410	5659	5659	S10-15	abstract	9	10	3.0	2.0	In this task, to the target word, not only the pronunciations but also the sense labels are provided for training; but for test, only the pronunciations are evaluated.	0
411	5660	5660	S10-15	abstract	10	11	3.0	2.0	The challenge of this task is the much skewed distribution in real text: the most frequent pronunciation occupies usually over 80%.	0
412	5661	5661	S10-15	abstract	11	12	3.0	2.0	In this task, we will provide a large volume of training data (each homograph word has at least 300 instances) accordance with the truly distribution in real text.	0
413	5662	5662	S10-15	abstract	12	13	4.0	3.0	In the test data, we will provide at least 100 instances for each target word.	0

417	5800	5800	S10-17	Conclusions	1	127	1.0	4.0	Domain portability and adaptation of NLP components and Word Sense Disambiguation systems present new challenges.	0
418	5801	5801	S10-17	Conclusions	2	128	1.0	4.0	The difficulties found by supervised systems to adapt might change the way we assess the strengths and weaknesses of supervised and knowledge-based WSD systems.	0
419	5802	5802	S10-17	Conclusions	3	129	2.0	4.0	With this paper we have motivated the creation of an all-words test dataset for WSD on the environment domain in several languages, and presented the overall design of this SemEval task.	1
420	5803	5803	S10-17	Conclusions	4	130	2.0	4.0	One of the goals of the exercise was to show that WSD systems could make use of unannotated background corpora to adapt to the domain and improve their results.	0
421	5804	5804	S10-17	Conclusions	5	131	3.0	4.0	Although it's early to reach hard conclusions, the results show that in each of the datasets, knowledge-based systems are able to improve their results using background text, and in two datasets the adaptation of knowledge-based systems leads to results over the MFS baseline.	0
422	5805	5805	S10-17	Conclusions	6	132	3.0	4.0	The evidence of domain adaptation of supervised systems is weaker, as only one team tried, and the differences with respect to MFS are very small.	0
423	5806	5806	S10-17	Conclusions	7	133	4.0	4.0	The best results for English are obtained by a system that combines a knowledge-based system with some targeted hand-tagging.	0

426	5975	5975	S10-19	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	This paper reports an overview of the SemEval-2 Japanese Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task.	0
427	5976	5976	S10-19	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	It can be considered an extension of the SENSEVAL-2 Japanese monolingual dictionarybased task (Shirai, 2001), so it is a lexical sample task.	0
428	5977	5977	S10-19	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Word senses are defined according to the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten (Nishio et al., 1994), a Japanese dictionary published by Iwanami Shoten.	0
429	5978	5978	S10-19	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	It was distributed to participants as a sense inventory.	0
430	5979	5979	S10-19	Introduction	5	12	1.0	1.0	Our task has the following two new characteristics:	0
431	5980	5980	S10-19	Introduction	6	13	1.0	1.0	1	0
432	5981	5981	S10-19	Introduction	7	14	1.0	1.0	All previous Japanese sense-tagged corpora were from newspaper articles, while sensetagged corpora were constructed in English on balanced corpora, such as Brown corpus and BNC corpus.	0
433	5982	5982	S10-19	Introduction	8	15	2.0	1.0	The first balanced corpus of contemporary written Japanese (BCCWJ corpus) is now being constructed as part of a national project in Japan (Maekawa, 2008), and we are now constructing a sense-tagged corpus based on it.	0
434	5983	5983	S10-19	Introduction	9	16	2.0	1.0	Therefore, the task will use the first balanced Japanese sense-tagged corpus.	0
435	5984	5984	S10-19	Introduction	10	17	2.0	1.0	Because a balanced corpus consists of documents from multiple genres, the corpus can be divided into multiple sub-corpora of a genre.	0
436	5985	5985	S10-19	Introduction	11	18	2.0	1.0	In supervised learning approaches on word sense disambiguation, because word sense distribution might vary across different sub-corpora, we need to take into account the genres of training and test corpora.	0
437	5986	5986	S10-19	Introduction	12	19	2.0	1.0	Therefore, word sense disambiguation on a balanced corpus requires tackling a kind of domain (genre) adaptation problem (Chang and Ng, 2006;	0
438	5987	5987	S10-19	Introduction	13	20	2.0	1.0	Agirre and de Lacalle, 2008).	0
439	5988	5988	S10-19	Introduction	14	21	2.0	1.0	2. In previous WSD tasks, systems have been required to select a sense from a given set of senses in a dictionary for a word in one context (an instance).	1
440	5989	5989	S10-19	Introduction	15	22	3.0	1.0	However, the set of senses in the dictionary is not always complete.	0
441	5990	5990	S10-19	Introduction	16	23	3.0	1.0	New word senses sometimes appear after the dictionary has been compiled.	0
442	5991	5991	S10-19	Introduction	17	24	3.0	1.0	Therefore, some instances might have a sense that cannot be found in the dictionary's set.	0
443	5992	5992	S10-19	Introduction	18	25	3.0	1.0	The task will take into account not only the instances that have a sense in the given set but also the instances that have a sense that cannot be found in the set.	0
444	5993	5993	S10-19	Introduction	19	26	3.0	1.0	In the latter case, systems should output that the instances have a sense that is not in the set.	0
445	5994	5994	S10-19	Introduction	20	27	3.0	1.0	Training data, a corpus that consists of three genres (books, newspaper articles, and white papers) and is manually annotated with sense IDs, was also distributed to participants.	0
446	5995	5995	S10-19	Introduction	21	28	3.0	1.0	For the evaluation, we distributed a corpus that consists of four genres (books, newspaper articles, white papers, and documents from a Q&amp;	0
447	5996	5996	S10-19	Introduction	22	29	4.0	1.0	A site on the WWW) with marked target words as test data.	0
448	5997	5997	S10-19	Introduction	23	30	4.0	1.0	Participants were requested to assign one or more sense IDs to each target word, optionally with associated probabilities.	0
449	5998	5998	S10-19	Introduction	24	31	4.0	1.0	The number of target words was 50, with 22 nouns, 23 verbs, and 5 adjectives.	0
450	5999	5999	S10-19	Introduction	25	32	4.0	1.0	Fifty instances of each target word were provided, con-sisting of a total of 2,500 instances for the evaluation.	0
451	6000	6000	S10-19	Introduction	26	33	4.0	1.0	In what follows, section two describes the details of the data used in the Japanese WSD task.	0
452	6001	6001	S10-19	Introduction	27	34	4.0	1.0	Section three describes the process to construct the sense tagged data, including the analysis of an inter-annotator agreement.	0
453	6002	6002	S10-19	Introduction	28	35	4.0	1.0	Section four briefly introduces participating systems and section five describes their results.	0

455	6144	6144	S12-1	Task definition	1	27	1.0	1.0	"Given a short context, a target word in English, and several substitutes for the target word that are deemed adequate for that context, the goal of the English Simplification task at SemEval-2012 is to rank these substitutes according to how ""simple"" they are, allowing ties."	1
456	6145	6145	S12-1	Task definition	2	28	2.0	1.0	Simple words/phrases are loosely defined as those which can be understood by a wide range of people, including those with low literacy levels or some cognitive disability, children, and non-native speakers of English.	0
457	6146	6146	S12-1	Task definition	3	29	2.0	1.0	In particular, the data provided as part of the task is annotated by fluent but non-native speakers of English.	0
458	6147	6147	S12-1	Task definition	4	30	3.0	1.0	The task thus essentially involves comparing words or phrases and determining their order of complexity.	0
459	6148	6148	S12-1	Task definition	5	31	3.0	1.0	By ranking the candidates, as opposed to categorizing them into specific labels (simple, moderate, complex, etc.), we avoid the need for a fixed number of categories and for more subjective judgments.	0
460	6149	6149	S12-1	Task definition	6	32	4.0	1.0	Also ranking enables a more natural and intuitive way for humans (and systems) to perform annotations by preventing them from treating each individual case in isolation, as opposed to relative to each other.	0
461	6150	6150	S12-1	Task definition	7	33	4.0	1.0	However, the inherent subjectivity introduced by ranking entails higher disagreement among human annotators, and more complexity for systems to tackle.	0
462	6351	6351	S12-2	Objective	1	42	1.0	1.0	Our task is to rate word pairs by the degree to which they are prototypical members of a given relation class.	1
463	6352	6352	S12-2	Objective	2	43	2.0	1.0	The relation class is specified by a few paradigmatic (highly prototypical) examples of word pairs that belong to the class and also by a schematic representation of the relation class.	0
464	6353	6353	S12-2	Objective	3	44	2.0	1.0	The task requires comparing a word pair to the paradigmatic examples and/or the schematic representation.	0
465	6354	6354	S12-2	Objective	4	45	3.0	1.0	For example, suppose the relation class is REVERSE.	0
466	6355	6355	S12-2	Objective	5	46	3.0	1.0	"We may specify this class by the paradigmatic examples attack:defend, buy:sell, love:hate, and the schematic representation ""X is the reverse act of Y "" or ""X may be undone by Y ."""	0
467	6356	6356	S12-2	Objective	6	47	4.0	1.0	Given a pair such as repair:break, we compare this pair to the paradigmatic examples and/or the schematic representation, in order to estimate its degree of prototypicality.	0
468	6357	6357	S12-2	Objective	7	48	4.0	1.0	The challenges are (1) to infer the relation from the paradigmatic examples and identify what relational or featural attributes best characterize that relation, and (2) to identify the relation of the given pair and rate how similar it is to that shared by the paradigmatic examples.	0
469	6532	6532	S12-3	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	This SemEval2012 shared task is based on a recently introduced spatial annotation scheme called Spatial Role Labeling.	0
470	6533	6533	S12-3	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The Spatial Role Labeling task concerns the extraction of main components of the spatial semantics from natural language: trajectors, landmarks and spatial indicators.	1
471	6534	6534	S12-3	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	In addition to these major components, the links between them and the general-type of spatial relationships including region, direction and distance are targeted.	1
472	6535	6535	S12-3	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	The annotated dataset contains about 1213 sentences which describe 612 images of the CLEF IAPR TC-12 Image Benchmark.	0
473	6536	6536	S12-3	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	We have one participant system with two runs.	0
474	6537	6537	S12-3	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	The participant's runs are compared to the system in (Kordjamshidi et al., 2011c) which is provided by task organizers.	0
475	6766	6766	S12-4	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	This task focuses on evaluating word similarity computation in Chinese.	1

493	7432	7432	S13-1	Introduction	1	5	1.0	1.0	The TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) was added as a new task in SemEval-2007.	0
494	7433	7433	S13-1	Introduction	2	6	1.0	1.0	The ultimate aim of research in this area is the automatic identification of temporal expressions (timexes), events, and temporal relations within a text as specified in TimeML annotation (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).	1
495	7434	7434	S13-1	Introduction	3	7	1.0	1.0	However, since addressing this aim in a first evaluation challenge was deemed too difficult a staged approach was suggested.	0
496	7435	7435	S13-1	Introduction	4	8	1.0	1.0	TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1) was an initial evaluation exercise focusing only on the categorization of temporal relations and only in English.	0

584	8404	8404	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	1	85	1.0	2.0	According to the standard definition of Textual Entailment, given two text fragments called Text (T) and Hypothesis (H), it is said that T entails H if, typically, a human reading T would infer that H is most likely true (Dagan et al., 2006).	0
585	8405	8405	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	2	86	1.0	2.0	In a typical answer assessment scenario, we expect that a correct student answer would entail the reference answer, while an incorrect answer would not.	0
586	8406	8406	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	3	87	1.0	2.0	However, students often skip details that are mentioned in the question or may be inferred from it, while reference answers often repeat or make explicit information that appears in or is implied from the question, as in Example 2 in Figure 1.	0
587	8407	8407	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	4	88	2.0	2.0	Hence, a more precise formulation of the task in this context considers the entailing text T as consisting of both the original question and the student answer, while H is the reference answer.	1
588	8408	8408	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	5	89	2.0	2.0	We carried out a feasibility study to check how well the entailment judgments in this formulation align with the annotated response assessment, by annotating a sample of the data used in the SRA task with entailment judgments.	0
589	8409	8409	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	6	90	2.0	2.0	"We found that some answers labeled as ""correct"" implied inferred or assumed pieces of information not present in the text."	0
590	8410	8410	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	7	91	2.0	2.0	These reflected the teachers' assessment of student understanding but would not be considered entailed from the traditional RTE perspective.	0
591	8411	8411	S13-7	RTE perspective and 2-and 3-way Tasks	8	92	3.0	2.0	However, we observed that in most such cases, a substantial part of the hypothesis was still implied by the text.	0

604	9204	9204	S13-12	Task Setup	1	25	2.0	1.0	The task required participating systems to annotate nouns in a test corpus with the most appropriate sense from the BabelNet sense inventory or, alternatively, from two main subsets of it, namely the WordNet or Wikipedia sense inventories.	1
605	9205	9205	S13-12	Task Setup	2	26	4.0	1.0	In contrast to previous all-words WSD tasks we did not focus on the other three open classes (i.e., verbs, adjectives and adverbs) since BabelNet does not currently provide non-English coverage for them.	0
606	9582	9582	S14-1	The Task	1	23	1.0	1.0	The Task involved two subtasks.	1
607	9583	9583	S14-1	The Task	2	24	1.0	1.0	(i) Relatedness: predicting the degree of semantic similarity between two sentences, and (ii) Entailment: detecting the entailment relation holding between them (see below for the exact definition).	1
608	9584	9584	S14-1	The Task	3	25	1.0	1.0	Sentence relatedness scores provide a direct way to evaluate CDSMs, insofar as their outputs are able to quantify the degree of semantic similarity between sentences.	0
609	9585	9585	S14-1	The Task	4	26	2.0	1.0	On the other hand, starting from the assumption that understanding a sentence means knowing when it is true, being able to verify whether an entailment is valid is a crucial challenge for semantic systems.	0
610	9586	9586	S14-1	The Task	5	27	2.0	1.0	In the semantic relatedness subtask, given two sentences, systems were required to produce a relatedness score (on a continuous scale) indicating the extent to which the sentences were expressing a related meaning.	0
611	9587	9587	S14-1	The Task	6	28	2.0	1.0	Table 1 shows examples of sentence pairs with different degrees of semantic relatedness; gold relatedness scores are expressed on a 5-point rating scale.	0
612	9588	9588	S14-1	The Task	7	29	3.0	1.0	In the entailment subtask, given two sentences A and B, systems had to determine whether the meaning of B was entailed by A.	0
613	9589	9589	S14-1	The Task	8	30	3.0	1.0	In particular, systems were required to assign to each pair either the ENTAILMENT label (when A entails B, viz., B cannot be false when A is true), the CONTRA-DICTION label (when A contradicted B, viz.	0
614	9590	9590	S14-1	The Task	9	31	3.0	1.0	B is false whenever A is true), or the NEUTRAL label (when the truth of B could not be determined on the basis of A).	0
615	9591	9591	S14-1	The Task	10	32	4.0	1.0	Table 2 shows examples of sentence pairs holding different entailment relations.	0
616	9592	9592	S14-1	The Task	11	33	4.0	1.0	Participants were invited to submit up to five system runs for one or both subtasks.	0
617	9593	9593	S14-1	The Task	12	34	4.0	2.0	Developers of CDSMs were especially encouraged to participate, but developers of other systems that could tackle sentence relatedness or entailment tasks were also welcome.	0
618	9594	9594	S14-1	The Task	13	35	4.0	2.0	Besides being of intrinsic interest, the latter systems' performance will serve to situate CDSM performance within the broader landscape of computational semantics.	0

627	9894	9894	S14-3	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	Given two linguistic items, semantic similarity measures the degree to which the two items have the same meaning.	0
628	9895	9895	S14-3	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	Semantic similarity is an essential component of many applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and similarity measurements between all types of text as well as between word senses lend themselves to a variety of NLP tasks such as information retrieval (Hliaoutakis et al., 2006) or paraphrasing (Glickman and Dagan, 2003).	0
629	9896	9896	S14-3	Introduction	3	9	1.0	1.0	Semantic similarity evaluations have largely focused on comparing similar types of lexical items.	0
630	9897	9897	S14-3	Introduction	4	10	1.0	1.0	Most recently, tasks in SemEval (Agirre et al., 2012) and *SEM (Agirre et al., 2013) have introduced benchmarks for measuring Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between similar-sized sentences and phrases.	0

634	9901	9901	S14-3	Introduction	8	14	2.0	1.0	Notably, all of these evaluations have focused on comparisons between a single type, in contrast to application-based evaluations such as summarization and compositionality which incorporate textual items of different sizes, e.g., measuring the quality of a paragraph's sentence summarization.	0
635	9902	9902	S14-3	Introduction	9	15	2.0	1.0	Task 3 introduces a new evaluation where similarity is measured between items of different types: paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words and senses.	0
636	9903	9903	S14-3	Introduction	10	16	2.0	1.0	Given an item of the lexically-larger type, a system measures the degree to which the meaning of the larger item is captured in the smaller type, e.g., comparing a paragraph to a sentence.	1
637	9904	9904	S14-3	Introduction	11	17	3.0	1.0	We refer to this task as Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS).	0
638	9905	9905	S14-3	Introduction	12	18	3.0	1.0	A major motivation of this task is to produce semantic similarity systems that are able to compare all types of text, thereby freeing downstream NLP applications from needing to consider the type of text being compared.	0
639	9906	9906	S14-3	Introduction	13	19	3.0	1.0	"Task 3 enables assessing the extent to which the meaning of the sentence ""do u know where i can watch free older movies online without download?"" is captured in the phrase ""streaming vintage movies for free"", or how similar is ""circumscribe"" to the phrase ""beating around the bush."""	0
640	9907	9907	S14-3	Introduction	14	20	3.0	1.0	Furthermore, by incorporating comparisons of a variety of item sizes, Task 3 unifies in a single task multiple objectives from different areas of NLP such as paraphrasing, summarization, and compositionality.	0
641	9908	9908	S14-3	Introduction	15	21	3.0	1.0	Because CLSS generalizes STS to items of different types, successful CLSS systems can directly be applied to all STS-based applications.	0
642	9909	9909	S14-3	Introduction	16	22	4.0	1.0	Furthermore, CLSS systems can be used in other similarity-based applications such as text simplification (Specia et al., 2012), keyphrase identification (Kim et al., 2010), lexical substitution (McCarthy andNavigli, 2009), summariza-tion (Spärck Jones, 2007), gloss-to-sense mapping (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014b), and modeling the semantics of multi-word expressions (Marelli et al., 2014) or polysemous words (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014a).	0
643	9910	9910	S14-3	Introduction	17	23	4.0	1.0	Task 3 was designed with three main objectives.	0
644	9911	9911	S14-3	Introduction	18	24	4.0	1.0	First, the task should include multiple types of comparison in order to assess each type's difficulty and whether specialized resources are needed for each.	0
645	9912	9912	S14-3	Introduction	19	25	4.0	1.0	Second, the task should incorporate text from multiple domains and writing styles to ensure that system performance is robust across text types.	0
646	9913	9913	S14-3	Introduction	20	26	4.0	1.0	Third, the similarity methods should be able to operate at the sense level, thereby potentially uniting text-and sense-based similarity methods within a single framework.	0
647	10103	10103	S14-4	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a vital task both from an academic and a commercial standpoint.	0
648	10104	10104	S14-4	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, irrespective of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screen).	0

715	12594	12594	S15-7	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The task, subdivided in three subtasks, requires the automatic system to identify the time interval when the piece of news was written.	1
716	12595	12595	S15-7	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	The subtasks concern specific type of information that might be available in news.	0
717	12596	12596	S15-7	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	The intervals come in three grades: fine, medium and coarse according to their length.	0

720	12980	12980	S15-9	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	Current research in sentiment analysis (SA, henceforth) is mostly focused on lexical resources that store polarity values.	0
721	12981	12981	S15-9	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	For bag-of-words approaches the polarity of a text depends on the presence/absence of a set of lexical items.	0
722	12982	12982	S15-9	Introduction	3	9	1.0	1.0	This methodology is successful to detect opinions about entities (such as reviews) but it shows mixed results when complex opinions about events -involving perspectives and points of view -are expressed.	0
723	12983	12983	S15-9	Introduction	4	10	2.0	1.0	In terms of parts of speech involved, SA approaches tend to focus on lexical items that explicitly convey opinions -mainly adjectives, adverbs and several nouns -leaving verbs on the foreground.	0
724	12984	12984	S15-9	Introduction	5	11	2.0	1.0	Improvements have been proposed by taking into account syntax (Greene and Resnik 2009) and by investigating the connotative polarity of words (Cambria et al., 2009;	0

727	12987	12987	S15-9	Introduction	8	14	3.0	1.0	One of the key aspects of sentiment analysis, which has been only marginally tackled so far, is the identification of implicit polarity.	0
728	12988	12988	S15-9	Introduction	9	15	3.0	1.0	By implicit polarity we refer to the recognition of subjective textual units where no polarity markers are present but still people are able to state whether the text portion under analysis expresses a positive or negative sentiment.	0
729	12989	12989	S15-9	Introduction	10	16	4.0	1.0	Recently, methodologies trying to address this aspect have been developed, incorporating ideas from linguistic and psychological studies on the subjective aspects of linguistic expressions.	0
730	12990	12990	S15-9	Introduction	11	17	4.0	1.0	Aiming at promoting a more holistic approach to sentiment analysis, combining the detection of implicit polarity with the expression of opinions on events, we propose CLIPEval, a task based on a dataset of events annotated as instantiations of pleasant and unpleasant events (PE/UPEs henceforth) previously collected in psychological research as the ones that correlate with mood (both good and bad feelings) (Lewinsohn and Amenson, 1978;	1
731	12991	12991	S15-9	Introduction	12	18	4.0	1.0	MacPhillamy and Lewinsohn, 1982).	0
732	13357	13357	S15-10	Conclusion	1	252	1.0	4.0	We have described the five subtasks organized as part of SemEval-2015 Task 10 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter: detecting sentiment of terms in context (subtask A), classifiying the sentiment of an entire tweet, SMS message or blog post (subtask B), predicting polarity towards a topic (subtask C), quantifying polarity towards a topic (subtask D), and proposing real-valued prior sentiment scores for Twitter terms (subtask E).	1
733	13358	13358	S15-10	Conclusion	2	253	1.0	4.0	Over 40 teams participated in these subtasks, using various techniques.	0
734	13359	13359	S15-10	Conclusion	3	254	2.0	4.0	We plan a new edition of the task as part of SemEval-2016, where we will focus on sentiment with respect to a topic, but this time on a fivepoint scale, which is used for human review ratings on popular websites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.	0
735	13360	13360	S15-10	Conclusion	4	255	2.0	4.0	From a research perspective, moving to an ordered five-point scale means moving from binary classification to ordinal regression.	0
736	13361	13361	S15-10	Conclusion	5	256	3.0	4.0	We further plan to continue the trend detection subtask, which represents a move from classification to quantification, and is on par with what applications need.	0
737	13362	13362	S15-10	Conclusion	6	257	3.0	4.0	They are not interested in the sentiment of a particular tweet but rather in the percentage of tweets that are positive/negative.	0
738	13363	13363	S15-10	Conclusion	7	258	4.0	4.0	Finally, we plan a new subtask on trend detection, but using a five-point scale, which would get us even closer to what business (e.g. marketing studies), and researchers, (e.g. in political science or public policy), want nowadays.	0
739	13364	13364	S15-10	Conclusion	8	259	4.0	4.0	From a research perspective, this is a problem of ordinal quantification.	0
740	13400	13400	S15-11	Task Description	1	36	1.0	2.0	The task concerns itself with the classification of overall sentiment in micro-texts drawn from the micro-blogging service Twitter.	0
741	13401	13401	S15-11	Task Description	2	37	2.0	2.0	These texts, called tweets, are chosen so that the set as a whole contains a great deal of irony, sarcasm or metaphor, so no particular tweet is guaranteed to manifest a specific figurative phenomenon.	0
742	13402	13402	S15-11	Task Description	3	38	2.0	2.0	Since irony and sarcasm are typically used to criticize or to mock, and thus skew the perception of sentiment toward the negative, it is not enough for a system to simply determine whether the sentiment of a given tweet is positive or negative.	0
743	13403	13403	S15-11	Task Description	4	39	3.0	2.0	We thus use an 11point scale, ranging from -5 (very negative, for tweets with highly critical meanings) to +5 (very positive, for tweets with flattering or very upbeat meanings).	0
744	13404	13404	S15-11	Task Description	5	40	3.0	2.0	The point 0 on this scale is used for neutral tweets, or those whose positivity and negativity cancel each other out.	0
745	13405	13405	S15-11	Task Description	6	41	4.0	2.0	While the majority of tweets will have sentiments in the negative part of the scale, the challenge for participating systems is to decide just how negative or positive a tweet seems to be.	0
746	13406	13406	S15-11	Task Description	7	42	4.0	2.0	So, given a set of tweets that are rich in metaphor, sarcasm and irony, the goal is to determine whether a user has expressed a positive, negative or neutral sentiment in each, and the degree to which this sentiment has been communicated.	1

755	13888	13888	S15-14	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	We describe two tasks-named entity recognition (Task 1) and template slot filling (Task 2)-for clinical texts.	1
756	13889	13889	S15-14	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	The tasks leverage annotations from the ShARe corpus, which consists of clinical notes with annotated mentions disorders, along with their normalization to a medical terminology and eight additional attributes.	0
757	13890	13890	S15-14	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The purpose of these tasks was to identify advances in clinical named entity recognition and establish the state of the art in disorder template slot filling.	0
758	13891	13891	S15-14	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Task 2 consisted of two subtasks: template slot filling given gold-standard disorder spans (Task 2a) and end-to-end disorder span identification together with template slot filling (Task 2b).	0
759	13892	13892	S15-14	abstract	5	6	2.0	1.0	For Task 1 (disorder span detection and normalization), 16 teams participated.	0

765	14227	14227	S15-15	Conclusion	1	184	1.0	4.0	This paper introduces a new SemEval task to explore the use of Natural Language Processing systems for building dictionary entries, in the framework of Corpus Pattern Analysis.	0
766	14228	14228	S15-15	Conclusion	2	185	1.0	4.0	Dictionary entry building is split into three subtasks: 1) CPA parsing, where arguments and their syntactic and semantic categories have to be identified, 2) CPA clustering, in which sentences with similar patterns have to be clustered and 3) CPA automatic lexicography where the structure of patterns have to be constructed automatically.	1
767	14229	14229	S15-15	Conclusion	3	186	2.0	4.0	Drawing from the Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs, we have produced a high-quality resource for the advancement of semantic processing: it contains 121 verbs connected to a corpus of 17,000 sentences.	0
768	14230	14230	S15-15	Conclusion	4	187	2.0	4.0	This resource will be made freely accessible from the task website for more in depth future research.	0
769	14231	14231	S15-15	Conclusion	5	188	2.0	4.0	Task 15 has attracted 5 participants, 3 on subtask 1 and 2 on subtask 2.	0
770	14232	14232	S15-15	Conclusion	6	189	3.0	4.0	Subtask 1 proved to be more difficult for participants than expected, since no system beat the baseline.	0
771	14233	14233	S15-15	Conclusion	7	190	3.0	4.0	We however show that the submissions possess interesting features that should be put to use in future experiments on the dataset.	0
772	14234	14234	S15-15	Conclusion	8	191	3.0	4.0	Subtask 2's baseline was beaten by one of the participants on a large margin, despite the fact that the baseline is very competitive.	0
773	14235	14235	S15-15	Conclusion	9	192	4.0	4.0	It seems that splitting the task into 3 subtasks has had the benefit of attracting different approaches (supervised and unsupervised) towards the common target of the task, which is to build a dictionary entry.	0
774	14236	14236	S15-15	Conclusion	10	193	4.0	4.0	Lexicography is such a complex task that it needs major efforts from the NLP community to support it.	0
775	14237	14237	S15-15	Conclusion	11	194	4.0	4.0	We hope that this task will stimulate more research and the development of new approaches to the automatic creation of lexical resources.	0
776	14239	14239	S15-17	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	This paper describes the first shared task on Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation organised as part of SemEval-2015.	0

779	14242	14242	S15-17	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	A total of 45 taxonomies submitted by 6 participating teams were evaluated using standard structural measures, the structural similarity with a gold standard taxonomy, and through manual quality assessment of sampled novel relations.	0
780	14388	14388	S15-18	abstract	1	2	2.0	1.0	Task 18 at SemEval 2015 defines Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicate-argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.	1
781	14389	14389	S15-18	abstract	2	3	4.0	1.0	In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other language analysis sub-tasks, introduce and compare the semantic dependency target representations used, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results.	0
782	14634	14634	S16-1	Task Overview	1	79	1.0	2.0	STS presents participating systems with paired text snippets of approximately one sentence in length.	0
783	14635	14635	S16-1	Task Overview	2	80	1.0	2.0	The systems are then asked to return a numerical score indicating the degree of semantic similarity between the two snippets.	1
784	14636	14636	S16-1	Task Overview	3	81	1.0	2.0	Canonical STS scores fall on an ordinal scale with 6 specifically defined degrees of semantic similarity (see Table 1).	0
785	14637	14637	S16-1	Task Overview	4	82	1.0	2.0	While the underlying labels and their interpretation are ordinal, systems can provide real valued scores to indicate their semantic similarity prediction.	0
786	14638	14638	S16-1	Task Overview	5	83	1.0	2.0	Participating systems are then evaluated based on the degree to which their predicted similarity scores correlate with STS human judgements.	0
787	14639	14639	S16-1	Task Overview	6	84	2.0	2.0	Algorithms are free to use any scale or range of values for the scores they return.	0
788	14640	14640	S16-1	Task Overview	7	85	2.0	2.0	They are not punished for outputting scores outside the range of the interpretable human annotated STS labels.	0
789	14641	14641	S16-1	Task Overview	8	86	2.0	2.0	This evaluation strategy is motivated by a desire to maximize the flexibility in the design of machine learning models and systems for STS.	0
790	14642	14642	S16-1	Task Overview	9	87	2.0	2.0	It reinforces the assumption that computing textual similarity is an enabling component for other natural language processing applications, rather than being an end in itself.	0

792	14644	14644	S16-1	Task Overview	11	89	2.0	2.0	Both the English and the crosslingual Spanish-English STS subtasks use a 6 point similarity scale.	0
793	14645	14645	S16-1	Task Overview	12	90	3.0	2.0	A similarity label of 0 means that two texts are completely dissimilar; this can be interpreted as two sentences with no overlap in their meanings.	0
794	14646	14646	S16-1	Task Overview	13	91	3.0	2.0	The next level up, a similarity label of 1, indicates that the two snippets are not equivalent but are topically related to each other.	0
795	14647	14647	S16-1	Task Overview	14	92	3.0	2.0	A label of 2 indicates that the two texts are still not equivalent but agree on some details of what is being said.	0
796	14648	14648	S16-1	Task Overview	15	93	3.0	2.0	The labels 3 and 4, both indicate that the two sentences are approximately equivalent.	0
797	14649	14649	S16-1	Task Overview	16	94	3.0	2.0	However, a score of 3 implies that there are some differences in important details, while a score of 4 indicates that the differing details are not important.	0
798	14650	14650	S16-1	Task Overview	17	95	3.0	2.0	The top score of 5, denotes that the two texts being evaluated have complete semantic equivalence.	0
799	14651	14651	S16-1	Task Overview	18	96	4.0	2.0	In the context of the STS task, meaning equivalence is defined operationally as two snippets of text that mean the same thing when interpreted by a reasonable human judge.	0
800	14652	14652	S16-1	Task Overview	19	97	4.0	2.0	The operational approach to sentence level semantics was popularized by the recognizing textual entailment task (Dagan et al., 2010).	0
801	14653	14653	S16-1	Task Overview	20	98	4.0	2.0	It has the advantage that it allows the labeling of sentence pairs by human annotators without any training in formal semantics, while also being more useful and intuitive to work with for downstream systems.	0
802	14654	14654	S16-1	Task Overview	21	99	4.0	2.0	Beyond just sentence level semantics, the operationally defined STS labels also reflect both world knowledge and pragmatic phenomena.	0
803	14655	14655	S16-1	Task Overview	22	100	4.0	2.0	As in prior years, 2016 shared task participants are allowed to make use of existing resources and tools (e.g., WordNet, Mikolov et al. (2013)'s word2vec).	0
804	14656	14656	S16-1	Task Overview	23	101	4.0	2.0	Participants are also allowed to make unsupervised use of arbitrary data sets, even if such data overlaps with the announced sources of the evaluation data.	0
805	14849	14849	S16-2	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) (Agirre et al., 2015) measures the degree of equivalence in the underlying semantics of paired snippets of text.	0
806	14850	14850	S16-2	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	The idea of Interpretable STS (iSTS) is to explain why two sentences may be related/unrelated, by supplementing the STS similarity score with an explanatory layer.	0
807	14851	14851	S16-2	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Our final goal would be to enable interpretable systems, that is, systems that are able to explain which are the differences and commonalities between two sentences.	0
808	14852	14852	S16-2	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	For instance, let's assume the following two sentences drawn from a corpus of news headlines: 12 killed in bus accident in Pakistan 10 killed in road accident in NW Pakistan * * Authors listed in alphabetical order 1 http://at.qrci.org/semeval2016/task2/	0
809	14853	14853	S16-2	Introduction	5	12	1.0	1.0	The output of such a system would be something like the following:	0
810	14854	14854	S16-2	Introduction	6	13	1.0	1.0	The two sentences talk about accidents with casualties in Pakistan, but they differ in the number of people killed (12 vs. 10) and level of detail: the first one specifies that it is a bus accident, and the second one specifies that the location is NW Pakistan.	0
811	14855	14855	S16-2	Introduction	7	14	1.0	1.0	While giving such explanations comes naturally to people, constructing algorithms and computational models that mimic human level performance represents a difficult Natural Language Understanding (NLU) problem, with applications in dialogue systems, interactive systems and educational systems.	0
812	14856	14856	S16-2	Introduction	8	15	1.0	1.0	In the iSTS 2015 pilot task (Agirre et al., 2015), we defined a first step of such an ambitious system, which we follow in 2016.	0
813	14857	14857	S16-2	Introduction	9	16	1.0	1.0	Given the input (a pair of sentences), participant systems need first to identify the chunks in each sentence, and then, align chunks across the two sentences, indicating the relation and similarity score of each alignment.	1
814	14858	14858	S16-2	Introduction	10	17	2.0	1.0	The relation can be one of equivalence, opposition, specificity, similarity or relatedness, and the similarity score can range from 1 to 5.	0
815	14859	14859	S16-2	Introduction	11	18	2.0	1.0	Unrelated chunks are left unaligned.	0
816	14860	14860	S16-2	Introduction	12	19	2.0	1.0	An optional tag can be added to alignments for the cases where there is a difference in factuality or polarity.	0

818	14862	14862	S16-2	Introduction	14	21	2.0	1.0	The alignments between chunks in Figure 1 can be used to produce the kind of explanations shown in the previous example.	0
819	14863	14863	S16-2	Introduction	15	22	2.0	1.0	"In previous work, Brockett (2007) and Rus et al. (2012) produced a dataset where corresponding Figure 1: Example of a manual alignment of two sentences: ""12 killed in bus accident in Pakistan"" and ""10 killed in road accident in NW Pakistan""."	0

822	14866	14866	S16-2	Introduction	18	25	2.0	1.0	Although this alignment is useful, we wanted to move forward to the alignment of segments, and decided to align chunks (Abney, 1991).	0
823	14867	14867	S16-2	Introduction	19	26	3.0	1.0	Brockett (2007) did not provide any label to alignments, while Rus et al. ( 2012) defined a basic typology.	0
824	14868	14868	S16-2	Introduction	20	27	3.0	1.0	In our task, we provided a more detailed typology for the aligned chunks as well as a similarity/relatedness score for each alignment.	0
825	14869	14869	S16-2	Introduction	21	28	3.0	1.0	Contrary to the mentioned works, we first identified the segments (chunks in our case) in each sentence separately, and then aligned them.	0
826	14870	14870	S16-2	Introduction	22	29	3.0	1.0	"In a different strand of work, Nielsen et al. (2009) defined a textual entailment model where the ""facets"" (words under some syntactic/semantic relation) in the response of a student were linked to the concepts in the reference answer."	0
827	14871	14871	S16-2	Introduction	23	30	3.0	1.0	The link would signal whether each facet in the response was entailed by the reference answer or not, but would not explicitly mark which parts of the reference answer caused the entailment.	0
828	14872	14872	S16-2	Introduction	24	31	3.0	1.0	This model was later followed by Levy et al. (2013).	0
829	14873	14873	S16-2	Introduction	25	32	3.0	1.0	Our task was different in that we identified the corresponding chunks in both sentences.	0
830	14874	14874	S16-2	Introduction	26	33	3.0	1.0	We think that, in the future, the aligned facets could provide complementary information to chunks.	0
831	14875	14875	S16-2	Introduction	27	34	3.0	1.0	The SemEval Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task in 2015 contained a subtask on Interpretable STS (Agirre et al., 2015), showing that the task is feasible, with high inter-annotator agreement and system scores well above baselines.	0
832	14876	14876	S16-2	Introduction	28	35	4.0	1.0	The datasets comprised news headlines and image captions.	0
833	14877	14877	S16-2	Introduction	29	36	4.0	1.0	For 2016, the pilot subtask has been updated into a standalone task.	0
834	14878	14878	S16-2	Introduction	30	37	4.0	1.0	The restriction from the iSTS 2015 task to allow only one-to-one alignments has been now lifted, and we thus allow any number of chunks to be aligned to any number of chunks.	0
835	14879	14879	S16-2	Introduction	31	38	4.0	1.0	Annotation guidelines have been revised accordingly, including an updated chunking criterium for subordinate clauses and a better explanation of the instruc-tions.	0
836	14880	14880	S16-2	Introduction	32	39	4.0	1.0	The 2015 datasets were re-annotated and released as training data.	0
837	14881	14881	S16-2	Introduction	33	40	4.0	1.0	New pairs from news headlines and image captions have been annotated and used for test.	0
838	14882	14882	S16-2	Introduction	34	41	4.0	1.0	In addition, a new dataset of sentence pairs from the education domain has been produced, including train and test data.	0
839	14883	14883	S16-2	Introduction	35	42	4.0	1.0	The paper is organized as follows.	0
840	14884	14884	S16-2	Introduction	36	43	4.0	1.0	We first provide the description of the task, followed by the evaluation metrics and the baseline system.	0
841	14885	14885	S16-2	Introduction	37	44	4.0	1.0	Section 5 describes the participation, Section 6 the results, and Section 7 comments on the systems, tools and resources used.	0
842	15053	15053	S16-3	Introduction	1	14	1.0	1.0	"Building on the success of SemEval-2015 Task 3 ""Answer Selection in Community Question Answering"" 1 , we run an extension in 2016, which covers a full task on Community Question Answering (CQA) and which is, therefore, closer to the real application needs."	0
843	15054	15054	S16-3	Introduction	2	15	1.0	1.0	All the information related to the task, data, participants, results and publications can be found on the SemEval-2016 Task 3 website.	0
844	15055	15055	S16-3	Introduction	3	16	1.0	1.0	2 1 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task3 2 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task3 CQA forums such as Stack Overflow 3 and Qatar Living 4 , are gaining popularity online.	0
845	15056	15056	S16-3	Introduction	4	17	1.0	1.0	These forums are seldom moderated, quite open, and thus they typically have little restrictions, if any, on who can post and who can answer a question.	0
846	15057	15057	S16-3	Introduction	5	18	1.0	1.0	On the positive side, this means that one can freely ask any question and can then expect some good, honest answers.	0
847	15058	15058	S16-3	Introduction	6	19	1.0	1.0	On the negative side, it takes effort to go through all possible answers and to make sense of them.	0
848	15059	15059	S16-3	Introduction	7	20	1.0	1.0	For example, it is not unusual for a question to have hundreds of answers, which makes it very time-consuming for the user to inspect and to winnow through them all.	0
849	15060	15060	S16-3	Introduction	8	21	1.0	1.0	The present task could help to automate the process of finding good answers to new questions in a community-created discussion forum, e.g., by retrieving similar questions in the forum and by identifying the posts in the comment threads of those similar questions that answer the original question well.	0
850	15061	15061	S16-3	Introduction	9	22	1.0	1.0	"In essence, the main CQA task can be defined as follows: ""given (i) a new question and (ii) a large collection of question-comment threads created by a user community, rank the comments that are most useful for answering the new question""."	1
851	15062	15062	S16-3	Introduction	10	23	2.0	1.0	The test question is new with respect to the collection, but it is expected to be related to one or several questions in the collection.	0
852	15063	15063	S16-3	Introduction	11	24	2.0	1.0	The best answers can come from different question-comment threads.	0
853	15064	15064	S16-3	Introduction	12	25	2.0	1.0	In the collection, the threads are independent of each other and the lists of comments are chronologically sorted and contain some meta information, e.g., date, user, topic, etc.	0
854	15065	15065	S16-3	Introduction	13	26	2.0	1.0	The comments in a particular thread are intended to answer the question initiating that thread, but since this is a resource created by a community of casual users, there is a lot of noise and irrelevant material, apart from informal language usage and lots of typos and grammatical mistakes.	0
855	15066	15066	S16-3	Introduction	14	27	2.0	1.0	Interestingly, the questions in the collection can be semantically related to each other, although not explicitly.	0
856	15067	15067	S16-3	Introduction	15	28	2.0	1.0	Our intention was not to run just another regular Question Answering task.	0
857	15068	15068	S16-3	Introduction	16	29	2.0	1.0	"Similarly to the 2015 edition, we had three objectives: (i) to focus on semantic-based solutions beyond simple ""bag-ofwords"" representations and ""word matching"" techniques; (ii) to study the new natural language processing (NLP) phenomena arising in the community question answering scenario, e.g., relations between the comments in a thread, relations between different threads and question-to-question similarity; and (iii) to facilitate the participation of non IR/QA experts to our challenge."	0
858	15069	15069	S16-3	Introduction	17	30	2.0	1.0	The third point was achieved by explicitly providing the set of potential answers-the search engine step was carried out by us-to be (re)ranked and by defining two optional subtasks apart from the main CQA task.	0
859	15070	15070	S16-3	Introduction	18	31	2.0	1.0	Subtask A (Question-Comment Similarity): given a question from a question-comment thread, rank the comments according to their relevance (similarity) with respect to the question; Subtask B (Question-Question Similarity): given the new question, rerank all similar questions retrieved by a search engine, assuming that the answers to the similar questions should be answering the new question too.	0

861	15072	15072	S16-3	Introduction	20	33	3.0	1.0	A and B should give participants enough tools to create a CQA system to solve the main task.	0
862	15073	15073	S16-3	Introduction	21	34	3.0	1.0	Nonetheless, one can approach CQA without necessarily solving the two tasks above.	0
863	15074	15074	S16-3	Introduction	22	35	3.0	1.0	Participants were free to use whatever approach they wanted, and the participation in the main task and/or the two subtasks was optional.	0
864	15075	15075	S16-3	Introduction	23	36	3.0	1.0	A more precise definition of all subtasks can be found in Section 3.	0
865	15076	15076	S16-3	Introduction	24	37	3.0	1.0	Keeping the multilinguality from 2015, we provided data for two languages: English and Arabic.	0
866	15077	15077	S16-3	Introduction	25	38	3.0	1.0	For English, we used real data from the communitycreated Qatar Living forum.	0
867	15078	15078	S16-3	Introduction	26	39	3.0	1.0	The Arabic data was collected from medical forums, with a slightly different procedure.	0
868	15079	15079	S16-3	Introduction	27	40	3.0	1.0	We only proposed the main ranking CQA task on this data, i.e., finding good answers for a given new question.	0
869	15080	15080	S16-3	Introduction	28	41	4.0	1.0	Finally, we provided training data for all languages and subtasks with human supervision.	0

924	15888	15888	S16-6	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Here for the first time we present a shared task on detecting stance from tweets: given a tweet and a target entity (person, organization, etc.), automatic natural language systems must determine whether the tweeter is in favor of the given target, against the given target, or whether neither inference is likely.	1
925	15889	15889	S16-6	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The target of interest may or may not be referred to in the tweet, and it may or may not be the target of opinion.	0
926	15890	15890	S16-6	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Two tasks are proposed.	0
927	15891	15891	S16-6	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	Task A is a traditional supervised classification task where 70% of the annotated data for a target is used as training and the rest for testing.	0
928	15892	15892	S16-6	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	For Task B, we use as test data all of the instances for a new target (not used in task A) and no training data is provided.	0
929	15893	15893	S16-6	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	Our shared task received submissions from 19 teams for Task A and from 9 teams for Task B.	0
930	15894	15894	S16-6	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	The highest classification F-score obtained was 67.82 for Task A and 56.28 for Task B. However, systems found it markedly more difficult to infer stance towards the target of interest from tweets that express opinion towards another entity.	0
931	16163	16163	S16-7	Task Description	1	50	1.0	2.0	The task is formulated as follows: given a list of terms (single words and multi-word phrases), an automatic system needs to provide a score between 0 and 1 that is indicative of the term's strength of association with positive sentiment.	1
932	16164	16164	S16-7	Task Description	2	51	1.0	2.0	A score of 1 indicates maximum association with positive sentiment (or least association with negative sentiment) and a score of 0 indicates least association with positive sentiment (or maximum association with negative sentiment).	0
933	16165	16165	S16-7	Task Description	3	52	1.0	2.0	If a term is more positive than another, then it should have a higher score than the other.	0

972	16625	16625	S16-10	Introduction	3	7	1.0	1.0	We do not expect a POS tagger to only know a subset of the tags in the language.	0
973	16626	16626	S16-10	Introduction	4	8	2.0	1.0	Most POS tags accommodate unseen words and adapt readily to new text genres.	0
974	16627	16627	S16-10	Introduction	5	9	2.0	1.0	Together, these factors indicate a representation which achieves broad coverage.	0
975	16628	16628	S16-10	Introduction	6	10	2.0	1.0	Explicit analysis of lexical semantics, by contrast, has been more difficult to scale to broad coverage owing to limited comprehensiveness and extensibility.	0
976	16629	16629	S16-10	Introduction	7	11	2.0	1.0	The dominant paradigm of fine-grained word sense disambiguation, WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), is difficult to annotate in corpora, results in considerable data sparseness, and does not readily generalize to out-of-vocabulary words.	0
977	16630	16630	S16-10	Introduction	8	12	3.0	1.0	While the main corpus with WordNet senses, SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), does reflect several text genres, it is hard to expand SemCor-style annotations to new genres, such as social web text or transcribed speech.	0
978	16631	16631	S16-10	Introduction	9	13	3.0	1.0	This severely limits the applicability of SemCor-based NLP tools and restricts opportunities for linguistic studies of lexical semantics in corpora.	0
979	16632	16632	S16-10	Introduction	10	14	3.0	1.0	To address this limitation, in the DiMSUM 2016 shared task, 1 we challenged participants to analyze the lexical semantics of English sentences with a tagset integrating multiword expressions and noun and verb supersenses (following Schneider and Smith, 2015), on multiple nontraditional genres of text.	1
980	16633	16633	S16-10	Introduction	11	15	3.0	1.0	By moving away from fine-grained sense inventories and lexicalized, language-specific 2 annotation, we take a step in the direction of broadcoverage, coarse-grained lexical semantic analysis.	0
981	16634	16634	S16-10	Introduction	12	16	4.0	1.0	We believe this departure from the classical lexical semantics paradigm will ultimately prove fruitful for a variety of NLP applications in a variety of genres.	0

984	16637	16637	S16-10	Introduction	15	19	4.0	1.0	While the systems range in performance, all are below 60% in our composite evaluation, suggesting that further work is needed to make progress on this difficult task.	0
985	16913	16913	S16-11	Task Description	1	26	1.0	1.0	The Complex Word Identification task of SemEval 2016 invited participants to create systems that, given a sentence and a target word within it, can predict whether or not a non-native English speaker would be able to understand the meaning of the target word.	1
986	16914	16914	S16-11	Task Description	2	27	1.0	1.0	We chose non-native speakers as a target audience because, unlike second language learners and those with low literacy levels or conditions such as Aphasia and Dyslexia, non-native speakers of English have not yet been explicitly assessed with respect to their simplification needs.	0

1004	17103	17103	S16-12	Introduction	12	18	4.0	1.0	Because Clinical TempEval is based on real patient notes from the Mayo Clinic, participants go through a lengthy authorization process involving a data use agreement and an interview.	0
1005	17104	17104	S16-12	Introduction	13	19	4.0	1.0	For Clinical TempEval 2016, we streamlined this process and were able to authorize data access for more than twice as many participants as Clinical TempEval 2015.	0

1013	17406	17406	S16-14	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	While multiple approaches have been proposed to enrich such taxonomies with new concepts, these techniques are typically evaluated by measuring the accuracy at identifying relationships between words, e.g., that a dog is a canine, rather relationships between specific concepts.	0

1157	20906	20906	S18-3	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Although an unanimous definition of irony is still lacking in the literature, it is often identified as a trope whose actual meaning differs from what is literally enunciated.	0
1158	20907	20907	S18-3	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	Due to its nature, irony has important implications for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which aim to understand and produce human language.	0
1159	20908	20908	S18-3	Introduction	5	12	1.0	1.0	In fact, automatic irony detection has a large potential for various applications in the domain of text mining, especially those that require semantic analysis, such as author profiling, detecting online harassment, and, maybe the most well-known example, sentiment analysis.	0
1160	20909	20909	S18-3	Introduction	6	13	1.0	1.0	Due to its importance in industry, sentiment analysis research is abundant and significant progress has been made in the field (e.g. in the context of SemEval (Rosenthal et al., 2017)).	0

1162	20911	20911	S18-3	Introduction	8	15	2.0	1.0	The results revealed that, while sentiment classification performance on regular tweets reached up to F 1 = 0.71, scores on the ironic tweets varied between F 1 = 0.29 and F 1 = 0.57.	0
1163	20912	20912	S18-3	Introduction	9	16	2.0	1.0	In fact, it has been demonstrated that several applications struggle to maintain high performance when applied to ironic text (e.g. Liu, 2012;	0

1166	20915	20915	S18-3	Introduction	12	19	2.0	1.0	Like other types of figurative language, ironic text should not be interpreted in its literal sense; it requires a more complex understanding based on associations with the context or world knowledge.	0
1167	20916	20916	S18-3	Introduction	13	20	2.0	1.0	Examples 1 and 2 are sentences that regular sentiment analysis systems would probably classify as positive, whereas the intended sentiment is undeniably negative.	0

1171	20920	20920	S18-3	Introduction	17	24	3.0	1.0	"For human readers, it is clear that the author of example 1 does not feel blessed at all, which can be inferred from the contrast between the positive sentiment expression ""I feel so blessed"", and the negative connotation associated with getting ocular migraines."	0
1172	20921	20921	S18-3	Introduction	18	25	3.0	1.0	Although such connotative infor-mation is easily understood by most people, it is difficult to access by machines.	0
1173	20922	20922	S18-3	Introduction	19	26	3.0	1.0	Example 2 illustrates implicit cyberbullying; instances that typically lack explicit profane words and where the offense is often made through irony.	0
1174	20923	20923	S18-3	Introduction	20	27	3.0	1.0	"Similarly to example 1, a contrast can be perceived between a positive statement (""I'm looking forward to"") and a negative situation (i.e. experiencing hate)."	0
1175	20924	20924	S18-3	Introduction	21	28	3.0	1.0	To be able to interpret the above examples correctly, machines need, similarly to humans, to be aware that irony is used, and that the intended sentiment is opposite to what is literally enunciated.	0
1176	20925	20925	S18-3	Introduction	22	29	3.0	1.0	The irony detection task 1 we propose is formulated as follows: given a single post (i.e. a tweet), participants are challenged to automatically determine whether irony is used and which type of irony is expressed.	1
1177	20926	20926	S18-3	Introduction	23	30	4.0	1.0	We thus defined two subtasks:	0
1178	20927	20927	S18-3	Introduction	24	31	4.0	1.0	•	0
1179	20928	20928	S18-3	Introduction	25	32	4.0	1.0	Task A describes a binary irony classification task to define, for a given tweet, whether irony is expressed.	0
1180	20929	20929	S18-3	Introduction	26	33	4.0	1.0	•	0
1181	20930	20930	S18-3	Introduction	27	34	4.0	1.0	Task B describes a multiclass irony classification task to define whether it contains a specific type of irony (verbal irony by means of a polarity clash, situational irony, or another type of verbal irony, see further) or is not ironic.	0
1182	20931	20931	S18-3	Introduction	28	35	4.0	1.0	Concretely, participants should define which one out of four categories a tweet contains: ironic by clash, situational irony, other verbal irony or not ironic.	0
1183	20932	20932	S18-3	Introduction	29	36	4.0	1.0	It is important to note that by a tweet, we understand the actual text it contains, without metadata (e.g. user id, time stamp, location).	0
1184	20933	20933	S18-3	Introduction	30	37	4.0	1.0	Although such metadata could help to recognise irony, the objective of this task is to learn, at message level, how irony is linguistically realised.	0
1185	21120	21120	S18-4	Task Description	1	32	1.0	1.0	Let a mention be a nominal that refers to a singular or a collective entity (e.g., she, mom, Judy), and an entity be the actual person that the mention refers to.	0
1186	21121	21121	S18-4	Task Description	2	33	1.0	1.0	Given a dialogue transcribed in text where all mentions are detected, the objective is to find the entity for each mention, who can be either active or passive in the dialogue.	1
1187	21122	21122	S18-4	Task Description	3	34	2.0	1.0	In Figure 1, entities such as Ross, Monica, and Joey are the active speakers of the dialogue, whereas Jack and Judy are not although they are passively mentioned as mom and dad in this context.	0
1188	21123	21123	S18-4	Task Description	4	35	2.0	1.0	Linking such mentions to their global entities demands inferred knowledge about the kinship from other dialogues, challenging crossdocument resolution.	0
1189	21124	21124	S18-4	Task Description	5	36	2.0	1.0	Thus, character identification can be viewed as an entity linking task that aims for holistic understanding in multiparty dialogue.	0
1190	21125	21125	S18-4	Task Description	6	37	3.0	1.0	Most of previous works on entity linking have focused on Wikification, which links named entity mentions to their relevant Wikipedia articles (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007;	0
1191	21126	21126	S18-4	Task Description	7	38	3.0	1.0	Ratinov et al., 2011;Guo et al., 2013).	0
1192	21127	21127	S18-4	Task Description	8	39	4.0	1.0	Unlike Wikification where most entities come with structured information from knowledge bases (e.g., Infobox, Freebase, DBPedia), entities in character identification have no such precom-piled information, which makes this task even more challenging.	0
1193	21128	21128	S18-4	Task Description	9	40	4.0	1.0	It is similar to coreference resolution in a sense that it groups mentions into entities, but distinguished because this task requires to identify each mention group as a known person.	0
1194	21129	21129	S18-4	Task Description	10	41	4.0	1.0	In Figure 1, coreference resolution would give a cluster of the four mentions, {mom, woman, I, I}; however, it would not identify that cluster to be the entity Judy, which in this case is not possible to identify without getting contexts from other dialogues.	0

1203	21516	21516	S18-6	Tasks	1	29	1.0	1.0	The ultimate goal of the shared task is to interpret time expressions, identifying appropriate intervals that can be placed on a timeline.	1
1204	21517	21517	S18-6	Tasks	2	30	1.0	1.0	Given a document, a system must identify the time entities by detecting the spans of characters and labeling them with the proper SCATE type.	1
1205	21518	21518	S18-6	Tasks	3	31	1.0	1.0	Examples of time entities and their corresponding types in Figure 1 would be (6, DAY-OF-MONTH), (Saturday, DAY-OF-WEEK), (March, MONTH-OF-YEAR) or (since, BETWEEN).	0
1206	21519	21519	S18-6	Tasks	4	32	1.0	1.0	Besides the time entities explicitly expressed in the text, implicit occurrences must also be identified, like the THIS and LAST time entities in Figure 1 that do not have any explicit triggers in the text.	0
1207	21520	21520	S18-6	Tasks	5	33	1.0	1.0	Once time entities have been identified, they should be linked together using the relations described in the SCATE schema.	0
1208	21521	21521	S18-6	Tasks	6	34	1.0	1.0	Following with the example in Figure 1, the time entity 6 should be linked as a SUB-INTERVAL of March, Saturday should be a REPEATING-INTERVAL of the time entity other, and so on.	0
1209	21522	21522	S18-6	Tasks	7	35	1.0	1.0	Finally, all the time entities must be completed with some additional properties needed for their interpretation.	0
1210	21523	21523	S18-6	Tasks	8	36	2.0	1.0	For example, the time entity other should have a VALUE of 2, the END-INTERVAL of since is the Document Creation Time, etc.	0
1211	21524	21524	S18-6	Tasks	9	37	2.0	1.0	Once again, the properties required by each time entity type are defined by the SCATE schema.	0
1212	21525	21525	S18-6	Tasks	10	38	2.0	1.0	1 Every resulting graph, composed of a set of linked time entities, represents a time expression that can be semantically interpreted.	0
1213	21526	21526	S18-6	Tasks	11	39	2.0	1.0	For this purpose, we provide a Scala library 2 that reads the graphs in Anafora XML format (Chen and Styler, 2013) and converts them into intervals on the timeline.	0
1214	21527	21527	S18-6	Tasks	12	40	2.0	1.0	An example of interpreting the time entities corresponding to the expression every Saturday since March 6 relative to an anchor time of April 21, 2017 is given in Figure 2.	0
1215	21528	21528	S18-6	Tasks	13	41	2.0	2.0	In this example, the values today and result store the entities that represent the time expressions April 21, 2017 and every Saturday since March 6 respectively.	0
1216	21529	21529	S18-6	Tasks	14	42	2.0	2.0	The Scala command on the right side interprets the latter and produces the corresponding time intervals.	0
1217	21530	21530	S18-6	Tasks	15	43	3.0	2.0	The task includes two evaluation methods, one for the parsing step, i.e. time entity identification scala&gt; for (Interval(start, end) &lt;-result.intervals) | println(start, end) (2017-03-11T00:00,2017-03-12T00:00) (2017-03-18T00:00,2017-03-19T00:00) (2017-03-25T00:00,2017-03-26T00:00) (2017-04-01T00:00,2017-04-02T00:00) (2017-04-08T00:00,2017-04-09T00:00) (2017-04-15T00:00,2017-04-16T00:00) (2017-04-22T00:00,2017-04-23T00:00) ... and linking, and one to score the resulting time intervals.	0
1218	21531	21531	S18-6	Tasks	16	44	3.0	2.0	For the later, we only consider time expressions that yield a finite set of bounded intervals, for example, last Monday.	0
1219	21532	21532	S18-6	Tasks	17	45	3.0	2.0	Time expressions that refer to an infinite set of intervals, like every month, are not considered in the interval-based part of the evaluation.	0
1220	21533	21533	S18-6	Tasks	18	46	3.0	2.0	Participants only need to produce Anafora outputs with parsed time entities; the interpretation is carried out by the evaluation system.	0
1221	21534	21534	S18-6	Tasks	19	47	3.0	2.0	The evaluation system is also able to obtain the intervals from timestamps in TimeML format.	0
1222	21535	21535	S18-6	Tasks	20	48	3.0	2.0	Thus, systems can be evaluated by both methods or just by the interval-based one, depending on the output format.	0
1223	21536	21536	S18-6	Tasks	21	49	3.0	2.0	In summary, the tasks offers two tracks:	0
1224	21537	21537	S18-6	Tasks	22	50	4.0	2.0	Track 1: Parse text to time entities.	0
1225	21538	21538	S18-6	Tasks	23	51	4.0	2.0	Systems must identify time entities in text and link them correctly to signal how they have to be composed.	0
1226	21539	21539	S18-6	Tasks	24	52	4.0	2.0	The output must be given in Anafora format.	0
1227	21540	21540	S18-6	Tasks	25	53	4.0	2.0	In this track, all time entities and relations of every time expression are evaluated.	0
1228	21541	21541	S18-6	Tasks	26	54	4.0	2.0	Track 2: Produce time intervals.	0
1229	21542	21542	S18-6	Tasks	27	55	4.0	2.0	Systems can participate through Track 1 or by providing TimeML annotations.	0
1230	21543	21543	S18-6	Tasks	28	56	4.0	2.0	In both cases, the intervals are inferred by our interpreter.	0
1231	21544	21544	S18-6	Tasks	29	57	4.0	2.0	In this track, only bounded time intervals are scored.	0

1238	21663	21663	S18-7	Introduction	7	13	3.0	1.0	This ambition involves the identification and classification of concepts, and the relations connecting them.	0
1239	21664	21664	S18-7	Introduction	8	14	4.0	1.0	The purpose of the task is to automatically identify relevant domain-specific semantic relations in a corpus of scientific publications.	1
1240	21665	21665	S18-7	Introduction	9	15	4.0	1.0	"In particular, we search for and classify relations that provide snippets of information such as ""a (new) method is proposed for a task"", or ""a phenomenon is found in a certain context"", or ""results of different experiments are compared to each other""."	0

1248	22072	22072	S18-9	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Instead, our reformulated task is defined as follows: given an input term, retrieve (or discover) its suitable hypernyms from a target corpus.	1
1249	22073	22073	S18-9	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	We proposed five different subtasks covering three languages (English, Spanish, and Italian), and two specific domains of knowledge in English (Medical and Music).	0

1253	22301	22301	S18-10	Task description	1	12	1.0	1.0	A semantic model that has only been evaluated on similarity detection may very well fail to be of practical use for specific applications.	0
1254	22302	22302	S18-10	Task description	2	13	1.0	1.0	For example, word sense disambiguation could benefit greatly from representations that can model complex semantic relations.	0
1255	22303	22303	S18-10	Task description	3	14	1.0	1.0	This means that the evaluation of word representation models should not only be centered on semantic similarity and relatedness, and should include different, complementary tasks.	0
1256	22304	22304	S18-10	Task description	4	15	1.0	1.0	To fill this gap, we proposed a novel task of semantic difference detection as Task 10 of the SemEval 2018 workshop.	0
1257	22305	22305	S18-10	Task description	5	16	2.0	1.0	The goal of the systems in this case was to predict whether a word is a discriminative attribute between two other words.	1
1258	22306	22306	S18-10	Task description	6	17	2.0	1.0	For example, given the words apple and banana, is the word red a discriminative attribute?	0
1259	22307	22307	S18-10	Task description	7	18	2.0	1.0	Semantic difference is a ternary relation between two concepts (apple, banana) and a discriminative attribute (red) that characterizes the first concept but not the other.	0
1260	22308	22308	S18-10	Task description	8	19	2.0	1.0	By its nature, semantic difference detection is a binary classification task: given a triple apple,banana,red, the task is to determine whether it exemplifies a semantic difference or not.	0
1261	22309	22309	S18-10	Task description	9	20	3.0	1.0	In practice, when preparing the task, we started out with defining potential discriminative attributes as semantic features in the sense of (McRae et al., 2005): properties that people tend to think are important for a given concept.	0
1262	22310	22310	S18-10	Task description	10	21	3.0	1.0	McRae et al.'s features are expressed as phrases, but these phrases can usually be reconstructed from a single word (e.g. red as a feature of apple stands for the phrase is red, carpentry as a feature of hammer can be used as a shorthand of used for carpentry, etc.)	0
1263	22311	22311	S18-10	Task description	11	22	3.0	1.0	Given this general reconstructability, we have for simplicity used single words rather than phrases to represent features.	0
1264	22312	22312	S18-10	Task description	12	23	3.0	1.0	The same solution was also adopted in the feature norming studies by (Vinson and Vigliocco, 2008) and (Lenci et al., 2013).	0
1265	22313	22313	S18-10	Task description	13	24	4.0	1.0	Following McRae et al., we did not define discriminative features in purely logical but rather in psychological terms.	0
1266	22314	22314	S18-10	Task description	14	25	4.0	1.0	Accordingly, features are prototypical properties that subjects tend to associate to a certain concept.	0
1267	22315	22315	S18-10	Task description	15	26	4.0	1.0	For example, not all apples are red and some bananas are, but red tends to be judged as an important feature of apples and not of bananas.	0
1268	22316	22316	S18-10	Task description	16	27	4.0	1.0	We therefore fully trust human anno-tators in deciding what counts as a distinguishing attribute and what does not.	0

1283	22476	22476	S18-11	Introduction	15	21	1.0	1.0	In particular, we focus on commonsense knowledge about everyday activities, referred to as scripts.	0
1284	22477	22477	S18-11	Introduction	16	22	2.0	1.0	Scripts are sequences of events describing stereotypical human activities (also called scenarios), for example baking a cake, taking a bus, etc.	0

1289	22482	22482	S18-11	Introduction	21	27	2.0	1.0	Factual knowledge is mentioned explicitly in texts from sources such as Wikipedia and news papers.	0
1290	22483	22483	S18-11	Introduction	22	28	2.0	1.0	On the contrary, script knowledge is often implicit in the texts as it is assumed to be known to the comprehender.	0
1291	22484	22484	S18-11	Introduction	23	29	2.0	1.0	Because of this implicitness, learning script knowledge from texts is very challenging.	0

1332	22718	22718	S18-12	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	A natural language argument is composed of a claim as well as reasons given as premises for the claim.	0
1333	22719	22719	S18-12	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	The warrant explaining the reasoning is usually left implicit, as it is clear from the context and common sense.	0
1334	22720	22720	S18-12	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	This makes a comprehension of arguments easy for humans but hard for machines.	0
1335	22721	22721	S18-12	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	This paper summarizes the first shared task on argument reasoning comprehension.	0
1336	22722	22722	S18-12	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	Given a premise and a claim along with some topic information, the goal is to automatically identify the correct warrant among two candidates that are plausible and lexically close, but in fact imply opposite claims.	1
1337	22723	22723	S18-12	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	We describe the dataset with 1970 instances that we built for the task, and we outline the 21 computational approaches that participated, most of which used neural networks.	0

1343	22990	22990	S19-1	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	UCCA is a crosslinguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation.	0
1344	22991	22991	S19-1	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units.	0
1345	22992	22992	S19-1	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	The shared task has yielded improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline in all languages and settings.	0

1350	23448	23448	S19-3	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion.	0
1351	23449	23449	S19-3	abstract	5	6	2.0	1.0	In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes -Happy, Sad, Angry and Others.	1
1352	23450	23450	S19-3	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps.	0
1353	23451	23451	S19-3	abstract	7	8	3.0	1.0	A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants.	0

1359	23634	23634	S19-4	Task Definition	3	29	3.0	1.0	Hyperpartisan articles mimic the form of regular news articles, but are one-sided in the sense that opposing views are either ignored or fiercely attacked.	0
1360	23635	23635	S19-4	Task Definition	4	30	4.0	1.0	We deliberately disregard the distinction between left and right, since previous work has found that, in hyperpartisan form, both are more similar to each other in terms of style than either are to the mainstream (Potthast et al., 2018c).	0
1361	23636	23636	S19-4	Task Definition	5	31	4.0	1.0	The challenge of this task is to unveil the mimicking and to detect the hyperpartisan language, which may be distinguishable from regular news at the levels of style, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.	0
1362	23862	23862	S19-5	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	Hate Speech (HS) is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristics (Nockleby, 2000).	0
1363	23863	23863	S19-5	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	Given the huge amount of user-generated contents on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, and therefore possibly contrasting the HS diffusion, is becoming fundamental, for instance for fighting against misogyny and xenophobia.	0
1364	23864	23864	S19-5	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Some key aspects feature online HS, such as virality, or presumed anonymity, which distinguish it from offline communication and make it potentially also more dangerous and hurtful.	0

1373	23873	23873	S19-5	Introduction	12	19	3.0	1.0	Eval consists in detecting hateful contents in social media texts, specifically in Twitter's posts, against two targets: immigrants and women.	1
1374	23874	23874	S19-5	Introduction	13	20	3.0	1.0	Moreover, the task implements a multilingual perspective where data for two widespread languages, English and Spanish, are provided for training and testing participant systems.	0
1375	23875	23875	S19-5	Introduction	14	21	3.0	1.0	The motivations for organizing HatEval go beyond the advancement of the state of the art for HS detection for each of the involved languages and targets.	0
1376	23876	23876	S19-5	Introduction	15	22	3.0	1.0	The variety of targets of hate and languages provides a unique comparative setting, both with respect to the amount of data collected and annotated applying the same scheme, and with respect to the results achieved by participants training their systems on those data.	0
1377	23877	23877	S19-5	Introduction	16	23	3.0	1.0	Such comparative setting may help in shedding new light on the linguistic and communication behaviour against these targets, paving the way for the integration of HS detection tools in several application contexts.	0
1378	23878	23878	S19-5	Introduction	17	24	3.0	1.0	Moreover, the participation of a very large amount of research groups in this task (see Section 4) has improved the possibility of in-depth investigation of the involved phenomena.	0

1403	24239	24239	S19-7	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	"Since the first RumourEval shared task in 2017, interest in automated claim validation has greatly increased, as the danger of ""fake news"" has become a mainstream concern."	0
1404	24240	24240	S19-7	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	However automated support for rumour verification remains in its infancy.	0
1405	24241	24241	S19-7	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	It is therefore important that a shared task in this area continues to provide a focus for effort, which is likely to increase.	0
1406	24242	24242	S19-7	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Rumour verification is characterised by the need to consider evolving conversations and news updates to reach a verdict on a rumour's veracity.	0
1407	24243	24243	S19-7	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	As in RumourEval 2017 we provided a dataset of dubious posts and ensuing conversations in social media, annotated both for stance and veracity.	0
1408	24244	24244	S19-7	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	The social media rumours stem from a variety of breaking news stories and the dataset is expanded to include Reddit as well as new Twitter posts.	0
1409	24245	24245	S19-7	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	There were two concrete tasks; rumour stance prediction and rumour verification, which we present in detail along with results achieved by participants.	1
1410	24246	24246	S19-7	abstract	8	9	4.0	1.0	We received 22 system submissions (a 70% increase from RumourEval 2017) many of which used state-of-the-art methodology to tackle the challenges involved.	0

1413	24460	24460	S19-8	Overview	3	12	1.0	1.0	The speed of proliferation leaves little time for double-checking claims against the facts, which has proven critical in politics, e.g., during the 2016 presidential campaign in the USA, which was dominated by fake news in social media and by false claims.	0
1414	24461	24461	S19-8	Overview	4	13	1.0	1.0	Investigative journalists and volunteers have been working hard to get to the root of a claim and to present solid evidence in favor or against it.	0
1415	24462	24462	S19-8	Overview	5	14	1.0	1.0	Manual fact-checking is very time-consuming, and thus automatic methods have been proposed to speed-up the process, e.g., there has been work on checking the factuality/credibility of a claim, of a news article, or of an information source (Ba et al., 2016;	0

1420	24467	24467	S19-8	Overview	10	19	2.0	1.0	The process starts when a document is made public.	0
1421	24468	24468	S19-8	Overview	11	20	2.0	1.0	First, an intrinsic analysis is carried out in which check-worthy text fragments are identified.	0
1422	24469	24469	S19-8	Overview	12	21	2.0	1.0	Then, other documents that might support or rebut a claim in the document are retrieved from various sources.	0
1423	24470	24470	S19-8	Overview	13	22	2.0	1.0	Finally, by comparing a claim against the retrieved evidence, a system can determine whether the claim is likely true or likely false (or unsure, if no strong enough evidence either way could be found).	0
1424	24471	24471	S19-8	Overview	14	23	2.0	1.0	For instance, Ciampaglia et al. (2015) do this using a knowledge graph derived from Wikipedia.	0

1429	24476	24476	S19-8	Overview	19	28	3.0	1.0	However, the information shared by the users is not always correct or accurate.	0
1430	24477	24477	S19-8	Overview	20	29	3.0	1.0	There are multiple factors explaining the presence of incorrect answers in cQA forums, e.g., misunderstanding of the question, ignorance or maliciousness of the responder.	0
1431	24478	24478	S19-8	Overview	21	30	3.0	1.0	Also, as a result of our dynamic world, the truth is time-sensitive: something that was true yesterday may be false today.	0
1432	24479	24479	S19-8	Overview	22	31	3.0	1.0	Moreover, forums are often barely moderated and thus lack systematic quality control.	0
1433	24480	24480	S19-8	Overview	23	32	3.0	1.0	Here we focus on checking the factuality of questions and answers in cQA forums.	0
1434	24481	24481	S19-8	Overview	24	33	4.0	1.0	This aspect was ignored in recent cQA tasks (Ishikawa et al., 2010;	0

1438	24485	24485	S19-8	Overview	28	37	4.0	1.0	According to SemEval-2016 Task 3 (Nakov et al., 2016a), all three answers would be considered GOOD since they are formally answering the question.	0
1439	24486	24486	S19-8	Overview	29	38	4.0	1.0	Nevertheless, a 1 contains false information, while a 2 and a 3 are correct, as can be established from an official government website.	0
1440	24487	24487	S19-8	Overview	30	39	4.0	1.0	2 Checking the veracity of answers in a cQA forum is a hard problem, which requires putting together aspects of language understanding, modelling the context, integrating several information sources, uisng world knowledge and complex inference, among others.	0
1441	24488	24488	S19-8	Overview	31	40	4.0	1.0	Moreover, high-quality automatic fact-checking would offer better experience to users of cQA systems, e.g., the user could be presented with veracity scores, where low scores would warn the user not to completely trust the answer or to double-check it.	0
1442	24649	24649	S19-9	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	State of the art opinion mining systems provide numerical summaries of sentiments and tend to overlook additional descriptive and potentially useful content present in the opinionated text.	0
1443	24650	24650	S19-9	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	We stress that such content also encompass information like suggestions, tips, and advice, which is otherwise explicitly sought by the stakeholders.	0
1444	24651	24651	S19-9	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	For example, hotel reviews often contain room tips, i.e., which room should be preferred in a hotel.	0
1445	24652	24652	S19-9	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	Likewise, tips on restaurants, shops, sightseeing, etc. are also present within the hotel reviews.	0
1446	24653	24653	S19-9	Introduction	5	12	1.0	1.0	On the other hand, platforms like Tripadvisor 1 , which collect hotel and restaurant related opinions, request the reviewers to fill up the room tips section in addition to the hotel review.	0
1447	24654	24654	S19-9	Introduction	6	13	1.0	1.0	Likewise, sentences expressing advice, tips, and recommendations relating to a target entity can often be present in text available from different types of data sources, like blogs, microblogs, discussions, etc.	0
1448	24655	24655	S19-9	Introduction	7	14	1.0	1.0	Such sentences can be collectively referred to as suggestions.	0
1449	24656	24656	S19-9	Introduction	8	15	1.0	1.0	With the increasing availability of opinionated text, methods for automatic detection of suggestions can be employed for different use cases.	0
1450	24657	24657	S19-9	Introduction	9	16	1.0	1.0	Some example use cases are the extraction of suggestions for brand improvement, the extraction of tips and advice for customers, the extraction of the expressions of recommendations from unstructured data in order to aid recommender systems, or the summarisation of suggestion forums where suggestion providers often tend to provide context in their responses (Figure 1) which gets repetitive over a large number of responses relating to the same entity.	0
1451	24658	24658	S19-9	Introduction	10	17	2.0	1.0	The task of automatic identification of suggestions in a given text is referred to as suggestion mining (Brun and Hagege, 2013).	0
1452	24659	24659	S19-9	Introduction	11	18	2.0	1.0	Studies performed on suggestion mining have defined it as a sentence classification task, where class prediction has to be made on each sentence of a given text, classes being suggestion and non suggestion (Negi, 2016).	1
1453	24660	24660	S19-9	Introduction	12	19	2.0	1.0	State of the art opinion mining systems have mostly focused on identifying sentiment polarity of the text.	0
1454	24661	24661	S19-9	Introduction	13	20	2.0	1.0	Therefore, suggestion mining remains a very less explored problem as compared to sentiment analysis, specially in the context of recent advancements in neural network based approaches for feature learning and transfer learning.	0
1455	24662	24662	S19-9	Introduction	14	21	2.0	1.0	As suggestion mining is still an emerging research area, it lacks benchmark datasets and well defined annotation guidelines.	0
1456	24663	24663	S19-9	Introduction	15	22	2.0	1.0	A few early works were mostly rule based methods, mainly targeted towards the use case of extracting suggestions for product improvements (Brun and Hagege, 2013;	0
1457	24664	24664	S19-9	Introduction	16	23	2.0	1.0	Ramanand et al., 2010;Moghaddam, 2015).	0
1458	24665	24665	S19-9	Introduction	17	24	2.0	1.0	In our prior work, we performed early investigations on the problem definition and datasets, aiming for the statistical methods which also require benchmark train datasets in addition to the evaluation Figure 1: A post from the suggestion forum for Microsoft developers datasets (Negi and Buitelaar, 2015;.	0
1459	24666	24666	S19-9	Introduction	18	25	2.0	1.0	A few other works also evaluated statistical classifiers (Wicaksono and Myaeng, 2012;	0
1460	24667	24667	S19-9	Introduction	19	26	2.0	1.0	Dong et al., 2013), which employed mostly manually identified features, however only two other works (Wicaksono and Myaeng, 2012;	0
1461	24668	24668	S19-9	Introduction	20	27	3.0	1.0	Dong et al., 2013) provided their datasets.	0
1462	24669	24669	S19-9	Introduction	21	28	3.0	1.0	Suggestion mining still lacks well defined annotation guidelines, a multi-domain and cross-domain approach to the problem and benchmark datasets, which we address in our recent work (Negi et al., 2018).	0
1463	24670	24670	S19-9	Introduction	22	29	3.0	1.0	Therefore, we introduce this pilot shared task to disseminate suggestion mining benchmarks and evaluate state of the art methods for text classification on domain specific and cross domain training scenarios.	0
1464	24671	24671	S19-9	Introduction	23	30	3.0	1.0	The datasets released as a part of the shared task include the domains hotel reviews and software developers suggestion forum (see Table 1).	0
1465	24672	24672	S19-9	Introduction	24	31	3.0	1.0	Suggestion mining faces similar text processing challenges as other sentence or short text classification tasks related to opinion mining and subjectivity analysis, such as stance detection (Mohammad et al., 2016), or tweet sentiment classification (Rosenthal et al., 2015).	0
1466	24673	24673	S19-9	Introduction	25	32	3.0	1.0	Some of the observed challenges in suggestion mining are elaborated below:	0
1467	24674	24674	S19-9	Introduction	26	33	3.0	1.0	• Class imbalance: Usually, suggestions tend to appear sparsely among opinionated text, which leads to higher data annotation costs and results in a class distribution bias in the trained models.	0

1470	24677	24677	S19-9	Introduction	29	36	3.0	1.0	Text from social media and other sources usually contains figurative use of language, which demands pragmatic understanding from the models.	0
1471	24678	24678	S19-9	Introduction	30	37	4.0	1.0	For example, 'Try asking for extra juice at breakfast -its 22 euros!!!!!' is more of a sarcasm than a suggestion.	0
1472	24679	24679	S19-9	Introduction	31	38	4.0	1.0	Therefore, a sentence framed as a typical suggestions may not always be a suggestion and vice versa.	0
1473	24680	24680	S19-9	Introduction	32	39	4.0	1.0	A variety of linguistic strategies used in suggestions also make this task interesting from a computational linguistics perspective and labeled datasets can be leveraged for linguistic studies as well.	0
1474	24681	24681	S19-9	Introduction	33	40	4.0	1.0	• Context dependency:	0
1475	24682	24682	S19-9	Introduction	34	41	4.0	1.0	In some cases, context plays a major role in determining whether a sentence is a suggestion or not.	0
1476	24683	24683	S19-9	Introduction	35	42	4.0	1.0	For example, 'There is a parking garage on the corner of the Forbes showroom.' can be labeled as a suggestion (for parking space) when it appears in a restaurant review and a human annotator gets to read the full review.	0
1477	24684	24684	S19-9	Introduction	36	43	4.0	1.0	However, the same sentence would not be labeled as a suggestion if the text is aimed to describe the surroundings of the Forbes showroom.	0

1514	25575	25575	S20-2	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Lexical entailment (LE) is a fundamental asymmetric lexico-semantic relation, supporting the hierarchies in lexical resources (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet) and applications like natural language inference and taxonomy induction.	0
1515	25576	25576	S20-2	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	Multilingual and cross-lingual NLP applications warrant models for LE detection that go beyond language boundaries.	0
1516	25577	25577	S20-2	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	As part of SemEval 2020, we carried out a shared task (Task 2) on multilingual and cross-lingual LE.	0
1517	25578	25578	S20-2	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	The shared task spans three dimensions: (1) monolingual LE in multiple languages versus cross-lingual LE, (2) binary versus graded LE, and (3) a set of 6 diverse languages (and 15 corresponding language pairs).	0
1518	25579	25579	S20-2	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	We offered two different evaluation tracks: (a) distributional (Dist): for unsupervised, fully distributional models that capture LE solely on the basis of unannotated corpora, and (b)	0
1519	25580	25580	S20-2	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	Any: for externally informed models, allowed to leverage any resources, including lexico-semantic networks (e.g., WordNet or BabelNet).	0

1593	28139	28139	S21-1	Introduction	7	13	1.0	1.0	These scores indicate which words are likely to cause problems for a reader.	0
1594	28140	28140	S21-1	Introduction	8	14	1.0	1.0	The words that are identified as problematic can be the subject of numerous types of intervention, such as direct replacement in the setting of lexical simplification (Gooding and Kochmar, 2019), or extra information being given in the context of explanation generation .	0
1595	28141	28141	S21-1	Introduction	9	15	1.0	1.0	Whereas previous solutions to this task have typically considered the Complex Word Identification (CWI) task (Paetzold and Specia, 2016a;	0
1596	28142	28142	S21-1	Introduction	10	16	1.0	1.0	Yimam et al., 2018) in which a binary judgment of a word's complexity is given (i.e., is a word complex or not?), we instead focus on the Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) task (Shardlow et al., 2020) in which a value is assigned from a continuous scale to identify a word's complexity (i.e., how complex is this word?).	1
1597	28143	28143	S21-1	Introduction	11	17	1.0	1.0	We ask multiple annotators to give a judgment on each instance in our corpus and take the average prediction as our complexity label.	0
1598	28144	28144	S21-1	Introduction	12	18	1.0	1.0	The former task (CWI) forces each user to make a subjective judgment about the nature of the word that models their personal vocabulary.	0
1599	28145	28145	S21-1	Introduction	13	19	1.0	1.0	Many factors may affect the annotator's judgment including their education level, first language, specialism or familiarity with the text at hand.	0
1600	28146	28146	S21-1	Introduction	14	20	1.0	1.0	The annotators may also disagree on the level of difficulty at which to label a word as complex.	0
1601	28147	28147	S21-1	Introduction	15	21	1.0	1.0	One annotator may label every word they feel is above average difficulty, another may label words that they feel unfamiliar with, but understand from the context, whereas another annotator may only label those words that they find totally incomprehensible, even in context.	0
1602	28148	28148	S21-1	Introduction	16	22	1.0	1.0	Our introduction of the LCP task seeks to address this annotator confusion by giving annotators a Likert scale to provide their judgments.	0
1603	28149	28149	S21-1	Introduction	17	23	1.0	1.0	Whilst annotators must still give a subjective judgment depending on their own understanding, familiarity and vocabulary -they do so in a way that better captures the meaning behind each judgment they have given.	0
1604	28150	28150	S21-1	Introduction	18	24	1.0	1.0	By aggregating these judgments we have developed a dataset that contains continuous labels in the range of 0-1 for each instance.	0
1605	28151	28151	S21-1	Introduction	19	25	2.0	1.0	This means that rather than a system predicting whether a word is complex or not (0 or 1), instead a system must now predict where, on our continuous scale, a word falls (0-1).	0

1608	28154	28154	S21-1	Introduction	22	28	2.0	1.0	In the binary annotation setting of CWI some annotators may rightly consider this term non-complex, whereas others may rightly consider it to be complex.	0
1609	28155	28155	S21-1	Introduction	23	29	2.0	1.0	Whilst the meaning of the word is reasonably clear to someone with scientific training, the context in which it is used is unfamiliar for a lay reader and will likely lead to them considering it complex.	0
1610	28156	28156	S21-1	Introduction	24	30	2.0	1.0	In our new LCP setting, we are able to ask annotators to mark the word on a scale from very easy to very difficult.	0
1611	28157	28157	S21-1	Introduction	25	31	2.0	1.0	Each user can give their subjective interpretation on this scale indicating how difficult they found the word.	0
1612	28158	28158	S21-1	Introduction	26	32	2.0	1.0	Whilst annotators will inevitably disagree (some finding it more or less difficult), this is captured and quantified as part of our annotations, with a word of this type likely to lead to a medium complexity value.	0
1613	28159	28159	S21-1	Introduction	27	33	2.0	1.0	LCP is useful as part of the wider task of lexical simplification (Devlin and Tait, 1998), where it can be used to both identify candidate words for simplification (Shardlow, 2013) and rank potential words as replacements . LCP is also relevant to the field of readability assessment, where knowing the proportion of complex words in a text helps to identify the overall complexity of the text (Dale and Chall., 1948).	0

1646	28192	28192	S21-1	Introduction	60	66	4.0	2.0	Unlike the first task, this second task had two objectives.	0
1647	28193	28193	S21-1	Introduction	61	67	4.0	2.0	The first objective was the binary complex or non-complex classification of target words.	0
1648	28194	28194	S21-1	Introduction	62	68	4.0	2.0	The second objective was regression or probabilistic classification in which 13 teams were asked to assign the probability of a target word being considered complex by a set of language learners.	0
1649	28195	28195	S21-1	Introduction	63	69	4.0	2.0	A major difference in this second task was that datasets of differing genres: (TEXT GENRES) as well as English, German and Spanish datasets for monolingual speakers and a French dataset for multilingual speakers were provided (Yimam et al., 2018).	0
1650	28196	28196	S21-1	Introduction	64	70	4.0	2.0	Similar to 2016, systems made use of a variety of lexical features including word length (Wani et al., 2018;	0

1662	28382	28382	S21-2	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	In this paper, we introduce the first SemEval task on Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Wordin-Context disambiguation (MCL-WiC).	0
1663	28383	28383	S21-2	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	This task allows the largely under-investigated inherent ability of systems to discriminate between word senses within and across languages to be evaluated, dropping the requirement of a fixed sense inventory.	0
1664	28384	28384	S21-2	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Framed as a binary classification, our task is divided into two parts.	0
1665	28385	28385	S21-2	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	In the multilingual sub-task, participating systems are required to determine whether two target words, each occurring in a different context within the same language, express the same meaning or not.	1
1666	28386	28386	S21-2	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	Instead, in the crosslingual part, systems are asked to perform the task in a cross-lingual scenario, in which the two target words and their corresponding contexts are provided in two different languages.	1
1667	28387	28387	S21-2	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	We illustrate our task, as well as the construction of our manually-created dataset including five languages, namely Arabic, Chinese, English, French and Russian, and the results of the participating systems.	0

1669	28617	28617	S21-4	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	This paper introduces the SemEval-2021 shared task 4: Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning (ReCAM).	0
1670	28618	28618	S21-4	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	This shared task is designed to help evaluate the ability of machines in representing and understanding abstract concepts.	0
1671	28619	28619	S21-4	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Given a passage and the corresponding question, a participating system is expected to choose the correct answer from five candidates of abstract concepts in a cloze-style machine reading comprehension setup.	1
1672	28620	28620	S21-4	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Based on two typical definitions of abstractness, i.e., the imperceptibility and nonspecificity, our task provides three subtasks to evaluate the participating models.	0
1673	28621	28621	S21-4	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	Specifically, Subtask 1 aims to evaluate how well a system can model concepts that cannot be directly perceived in the physical world.	0
1674	28622	28622	S21-4	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	Subtask 2 focuses on models' ability in comprehending nonspecific concepts located high in a hypernym hierarchy given the context of a passage.	0
1675	28623	28623	S21-4	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	Subtask 3 aims to provide some insights into models' generalizability over the two types of abstractness.	0
1676	28624	28624	S21-4	abstract	8	9	4.0	1.0	During the SemEval-2021 official evaluation period, we received 23 submissions to Subtask 1 and 28 to Subtask 2.	0
1677	28625	28625	S21-4	abstract	9	10	4.0	1.0	The participating teams additionally made 29 submissions to Subtask 3.	0
1678	28884	28884	S21-5	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	Discussions online often host toxic posts, meaning posts that are rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable; and which can make users want to leave the conversation (Borkan et al., 2019a).	0
1679	28885	28885	S21-5	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	Current toxicity detection systems classify whole posts as toxic or not (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017;	0
1680	28886	28886	S21-5	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Pavlopoulos et al., 2017;Zampieri et al., 2019), often to assist human moderators, who may be required to review only posts classified as toxic, when reviewing all posts is infeasible.	0
1681	28887	28887	S21-5	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	In such cases, human moderators could be assisted even more by automatically highlighting spans of the posts that made the system classify the posts as toxic.	0
1682	28888	28888	S21-5	Introduction	5	12	2.0	1.0	This would allow the moderators to more quickly identify objectionable parts of the posts, especially in long posts, and more easily approve or reject the decisions of the toxicity detection systems.	0
1683	28889	28889	S21-5	Introduction	6	13	2.0	1.0	As a first step along this direction, Task 5 of SemEval 2021 provided the participants with posts previously rated to be toxic, and required them to identify toxic spans, i.e., spans that were responsible for the toxicity of the posts, when identifying such spans was possible.	1
1684	28890	28890	S21-5	Introduction	7	14	2.0	1.0	Note that a post may include no toxic span and still be marked as toxic.	0
1685	28891	28891	S21-5	Introduction	8	15	2.0	1.0	On the other hand, a non toxic post may comprise spans that are considered toxic in other toxic posts.	0
1686	28892	28892	S21-5	Introduction	9	16	3.0	1.0	We provided a dataset of English posts with gold annotations of toxic spans, and evaluated participating systems on a held-out test subset using character-based F1.	0
1687	28893	28893	S21-5	Introduction	10	17	3.0	1.0	The task could be addressed as supervised sequence labeling, training on the provided posts with gold toxic spans.	0
1688	28894	28894	S21-5	Introduction	11	18	3.0	1.0	It could also be treated as rationale extraction (Li et al., 2016;	0
1689	28895	28895	S21-5	Introduction	12	19	3.0	1.0	Ribeiro et al., 2016), using classifiers trained on larger external datasets of posts manually annotated as toxic or not, without toxic span annotations.	0
1690	28896	28896	S21-5	Introduction	13	20	4.0	1.0	There were almost 500 individual participants, and 36 out of the 92 teams that were formed submitted reports and results that we survey here.	0
1691	28897	28897	S21-5	Introduction	14	21	4.0	1.0	Most teams adopted the supervised sequence labeling approach.	0
1692	28898	28898	S21-5	Introduction	15	22	4.0	1.0	Hence, there is still scope for further work on the rationale extraction approach.	0
1693	28899	28899	S21-5	Introduction	16	23	4.0	1.0	We also discuss other possible improvements in the definition and data of the task.	0

1695	29121	29121	S21-6	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The task focused on memes and had three subtasks: (i) detecting the techniques in the text, (ii) detecting the text spans where the techniques are used, and (iii) detecting techniques in the entire meme, i.e., both in the text and in the image.	1
1696	29122	29122	S21-6	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	It was a popular task, attracting 71 registrations, and 22 teams that eventually made an official submission on the test set.	0
1697	29123	29123	S21-6	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	The evaluation results for the third subtask confirmed the importance of both modalities, the text and the image.	0
1698	29124	29124	S21-6	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	Moreover, some teams reported benefits when not just combining the two modalities, e.g., by using early or late fusion, but rather modeling the interaction between them in a joint model.	0

1700	29342	29342	S21-7	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	Task 7, HaHackathon, was the first shared task to combine the previously separate domains of humor detection and offense detection.	0
1701	29343	29343	S21-7	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	We collected 10,000 texts from Twitter and the Kaggle Short Jokes dataset, and had each annotated for humor and offense by 20 annotators aged 18-70.	0
1702	29344	29344	S21-7	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Our subtasks were binary humor detection, prediction of humor and offense ratings, and a novel controversy task: to predict if the variance in the humor ratings was higher than a specific threshold.	1
1703	29345	29345	S21-7	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	The subtasks attracted 36-58 submissions, with most of the participants choosing to use pre-trained language models.	0
1704	29346	29346	S21-7	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	Many of the highest performing teams also implemented additional optimization techniques, including task-adaptive training and adversarial training.	0
1705	29347	29347	S21-7	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	The results suggest that the participating systems are well suited to humor detection, but that humor controversy is a more challenging task.	0
1706	29348	29348	S21-7	abstract	8	9	4.0	1.0	We discuss which models excel in this task, which auxiliary techniques boost their performance, and analyze the errors which were not captured by the best systems.	0

1737	30020	30020	S21-10	Introduction	2	10	1.0	1.0	For example, Twitter policies do not allow sharing of tweet text, though tweet IDs may be shared.	0
1738	30021	30021	S21-10	Introduction	3	11	1.0	1.0	The situation is even more common in clinical NLP, where patient health information must be protected, and annotations over health text, when released at all, often require the signing of complex data use agreements.	0
1739	30022	30022	S21-10	Introduction	4	12	1.0	1.0	The Source-Free Domain Adaptation shared task presents a new framework that asks participants to develop semantic annotation systems in the face of data sharing constraints.	0
1740	30023	30023	S21-10	Introduction	5	13	1.0	1.0	A participant's goal is to develop an accurate system for a target domain when annotations exist for a related domain but cannot be distributed.	0
1741	30024	30024	S21-10	Introduction	6	14	1.0	1.0	Instead of annotated training data, participants are given a model trained on the annotations.	0

1749	30032	30032	S21-10	Introduction	14	22	2.0	1.0	Two different semantic tasks in English were created to explore this framework: negation detection and time expression recognition.	0
1750	30033	30033	S21-10	Introduction	15	23	2.0	1.0	These represent two common types of classification tasks: negation detection is typically formulated as predicting an attribute of a word or span given its context, and time expression recognition is typically formulated as a named entity tagging problem.	0
1751	30034	30034	S21-10	Introduction	16	24	2.0	1.0	Both of these tasks have previously been run as shared tasks, and had at least two different domains of data available, and we had access to experienced annotators for both tasks, allowing us to annotate data in a new domain.	0

1761	30044	30044	S21-10	Introduction	26	34	4.0	1.0	Time expression recognition has been a key component of previous temporal language related competitions, like TempEval 2010 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009) and TempEval 2013 (UzZaman et al., 2013).	0
1762	30045	30045	S21-10	Introduction	27	35	4.0	1.0	For this task, we followed the Compositional Annotation of Time Expressions (SCATE) schema (Bethard and Parker, 2016) used in in Sem-Eval 2018 Task 6 (Laparra et al., 2018).	0
1763	30046	30046	S21-10	Introduction	28	36	4.0	1.0	As in negation detection, previous works have also oberved a significant performance degradation on domain shift (Xu et al., 2019).	0

1848	31897	31897	W19-4226	Introduction	5	11	2.0	1.0	Many languages implement large inflectional paradigms that mark both function and content words with a varying levels of morphosyntactic information.	0
1849	31898	31898	W19-4226	Introduction	6	12	2.0	1.0	* Now at Google For instance, Romanian verb forms inflect for person, number, tense, mood, and voice; meanwhile, Archi verbs can take on thousands of forms (Kibrik, 1998).	0
1850	31899	31899	W19-4226	Introduction	7	13	3.0	1.0	Such complex paradigms produce large inventories of words, all of which must be producible by a realistic system, even though a large percentage of them will never be observed over billions of lines of linguistic input.	0
1851	31900	31900	W19-4226	Introduction	8	14	3.0	1.0	Compounding the issue, good inflectional systems often require large amounts of supervised training data, which is infeasible in many of the world's languages.	0

1905	34029	34029	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	1	5	1.0	1.0	The goal of this shared task is to evaluate the ability of NLP systems to detect whether a sentence from an instructional text requires clarification.	0
1906	34030	34030	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	2	6	1.0	1.0	Such clarifications can be critical to ensure that instructions are clear enough to be followed and the desired goal can be reached.	0
1907	34031	34031	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	3	7	2.0	1.0	We set up this task as a binary classification task, in which systems have to predict whether a given sentence in context requires clarification.	1
1908	34032	34032	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	4	8	2.0	1.0	Our data is based on texts for which revision histories exist, making it possible to identify (a) sentences that received edits which made the sentence more precise, and (b) sentences that remained unchanged over multiple text revisions.	0

1911	34035	34035	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	7	11	4.0	1.0	First, we apply a set of rules to identify a subset of edits that provide clarifying information.	0
1912	34036	34036	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	8	12	4.0	1.0	This makes it possible to focus mainly on those edits that are related to implicit and underspecified language, excluding grammar corrections and other edit types.	0
1913	34037	34037	2021.unimplicit-1.4	Introduction	9	13	4.0	1.0	Since the need for such edits may depend on discourse context, a second difference is that we provide context for each sentence to be classified (see Table 1).	0

1954	34582	34582	W04-2412	Introduction	4	7	1.0	1.0	Given a sentence, the task consists of analyzing the propositions expressed by some target verbs of the sentence.	1
1955	34583	34583	W04-2412	Introduction	5	8	1.0	1.0	In particular, for each target verb all the constituents in the sentence which fill a semantic role of the verb have to be extracted (see Figure 1 for a detailed example).	1

1957	34585	34585	W04-2412	Introduction	7	10	1.0	1.0	Most existing systems for automatic semantic role labeling make use of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in order to define argument boundaries and to extract relevant information for training classifiers to disambiguate between role labels.	0
1958	34586	34586	W04-2412	Introduction	8	11	2.0	1.0	Thus, the task has been usually approached as a two phase procedure consisting of recognition and labeling of arguments.	0

1966	34594	34594	W04-2412	Introduction	16	19	3.0	1.0	Nowadays, there exist two main English corpora with semantic annotations from which to train SRL systems: PropBank (Palmer et al., 2004) and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2001).	0
1967	34595	34595	W04-2412	Introduction	17	20	3.0	1.0	In the CoNLL-2004 shared task we concentrate on the PropBank corpus, which is the Penn Treebank corpus enriched with predicate-argument structures.	0

1974	34602	34602	W04-2412	Introduction	24	27	4.0	1.0	The challenge for CoNLL-2004 shared task is to come up with machine learning strategies which address the SRL problem on the basis of only partial syntactic information, avoiding the use of full parsers and external lexico-semantic knowledge bases.	0
1975	34603	34603	W04-2412	Introduction	25	28	4.0	1.0	The annotations provided for the development of systems include, apart from the argument boundaries and role labels, the levels of processing treated in the previous editions of the CoNLL shared task, i.e., words, PoS tags, base chunks, clauses, and named entities.	0

2016	35128	35128	D07-1096	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	Previous shared tasks of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) have been devoted to chunking (1999,2000), clause identification (2001), named entity recognition (2002,2003), and semantic role labeling (2004,2005).	0
2017	35129	35129	D07-1096	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	In 2006 the shared task was multilingual dependency parsing, where participants had to train a single parser on data from thirteen different languages, which enabled a comparison not only of parsing and learning methods, but also of the performance that can be achieved for different languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).	0
2018	35130	35130	D07-1096	Introduction	3	8	2.0	1.0	In dependency-based syntactic parsing, the task is to derive a syntactic structure for an input sentence by identifying the syntactic head of each word in the sentence.	1
2019	35131	35131	D07-1096	Introduction	4	9	2.0	1.0	This defines a dependency graph, where the nodes are the words of the input sentence and the arcs are the binary relations from head to dependent.	0
2020	35132	35132	D07-1096	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	Often, but not always, it is assumed that all words except one have a syntactic head, which means that the graph will be a tree with the single independent word as the root.	0
2021	35133	35133	D07-1096	Introduction	6	11	3.0	1.0	In labeled dependency parsing, we additionally require the parser to assign a specific type (or label) to each dependency relation holding between a head word and a dependent word.	0
2022	35134	35134	D07-1096	Introduction	7	12	3.0	1.0	In this year's shared task, we continue to explore data-driven methods for multilingual dependency parsing, but we add a new dimension by also introducing the problem of domain adaptation.	0
2023	35135	35135	D07-1096	Introduction	8	13	3.0	1.0	The way this was done was by having two separate tracks: a multilingual track using essentially the same setup as last year, but with partly different languages, and a domain adaptation track, where the task was to use machine learning to adapt a parser for a single language to a new domain.	0
2024	35136	35136	D07-1096	Introduction	9	14	4.0	1.0	In total, test results were submitted for twenty-three systems in the multilingual track, and ten systems in the domain adaptation track (six of which also participated in the multilingual track).	0
2025	35137	35137	D07-1096	Introduction	10	15	4.0	1.0	Not everyone submitted papers describing their system, and some papers describe more than one system (or the same system in both tracks), which explains why there are only (!) twenty-one papers in the proceedings.	0
2026	35138	35138	D07-1096	Introduction	11	16	4.0	1.0	In this paper, we provide task definitions for the two tracks (section 2), describe data sets extracted from available treebanks (section 3), report results for all systems in both tracks (section 4), give an overview of approaches used (section 5), provide a first analysis of the results (section 6), and conclude with some future directions (section 7).	0

2035	35524	35524	W08-2121	Introduction	9	15	2.0	1.0	Conceptually, the 2008 shared task can be divided into three subtasks: (i) parsing of syntactic dependencies, (ii) identification and disambiguation of semantic predicates, and (iii) identification of arguments and assignment of semantic roles for each predicate.	1
2036	35525	35525	W08-2121	Introduction	10	16	2.0	1.0	Several objectives were addressed in this shared task:	0
2037	35526	35526	W08-2121	Introduction	11	17	2.0	1.0	• SRL is performed and evaluated using a dependency-based representation for both syntactic and semantic dependencies.	0
2038	35527	35527	W08-2121	Introduction	12	18	2.0	1.0	While SRL on top of a dependency treebank has been addressed before (Hacioglu, 2004), our approach has several novelties: (i) our constituent-to-dependency conversion strategy transforms all annotated semantic arguments in PropBank and NomBank not just a subset; (ii) we address propositions centered around both verbal (PropBank) and nominal (NomBank) predicates.	0
2039	35528	35528	W08-2121	Introduction	13	19	2.0	1.0	• Based on the observation that a richer set of syntactic dependencies improves semantic processing (Johansson and Nugues, 2007), the syntactic dependencies modeled are more complex than the ones used in the previous CoNLL shared tasks.	0
2040	35529	35529	W08-2121	Introduction	14	20	3.0	1.0	For example, we now include apposition links, dependencies derived from named entity (NE) structures, and better modeling of long-distance grammatical relations.	0

2044	35533	35533	W08-2121	Introduction	18	24	3.0	1.0	The evaluation is separated into two different challenges: a closed challenge, where systems have to be trained strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and an open challenge, where systems can be developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.	0

2053	35863	35863	W09-1201	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	"Every year since 1999, the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) launches a competitive, open ""Shared Task""."	0
2054	35864	35864	W09-1201	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	"A common (""shared"") task is defined and datasets are provided for its participants."	0
2055	35865	35865	W09-1201	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	In 2004 and 2005, the shared tasks were dedicated to semantic role labeling (SRL) in a monolingual setting (English).	0
2056	35866	35866	W09-1201	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	In 2006 and 2007 the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies, using corpora from up to 13 languages.	0
2057	35867	35867	W09-1201	Introduction	5	10	1.0	1.0	In 2008, the shared task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) used a unified dependencybased formalism, which modeled both syntactic dependencies and semantic roles for English.	0
2058	35868	35868	W09-1201	Introduction	6	11	1.0	1.0	The CoNLL-2009 Shared Task has built on the 2008 results by providing data for six more languages (Catalan, Chinese, Czech, German, Japanese and Spanish) in addition to the original English 1 .	0
2059	35869	35869	W09-1201	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	It has thus naturally extended the path taken by the five most recent CoNLL shared tasks.	0
2060	35870	35870	W09-1201	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	As in 2008, the CoNLL-2009 shared task combined dependency parsing and the task of identifying and labeling semantic arguments of verbs (and other parts of speech whenever available).	1
2061	35871	35871	W09-1201	Introduction	9	14	2.0	1.0	Participants had to choose from two tasks:	0

2064	35874	35874	W09-1201	Introduction	12	17	2.0	1.0	• SRL-only task (syntactic dependency parses have been provided by the organizers, using state-of-the art parsers for the individual languages).	0
2065	35875	35875	W09-1201	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	In contrast to the previous year, the evaluation data indicated which words were to be dealt with (for the SRL task).	0
2066	35876	35876	W09-1201	Introduction	14	19	3.0	1.0	In other words, (predicate) disambiguation was still part of the task, whereas the identification of argument-bearing words was not.	0
2067	35877	35877	W09-1201	Introduction	15	20	3.0	1.0	This decision was made to compensate for the significant differences between languages and between the annotation schemes used.	0
2068	35878	35878	W09-1201	Introduction	16	21	3.0	1.0	"The ""closed"" and ""open"" challenges have been kept from last year as well; participants could have chosen one or both."	0
2069	35879	35879	W09-1201	Introduction	17	22	3.0	1.0	In the closed challenge, systems had to be trained strictly with information contained in the given training corpus; in the open challenge, systems could have been developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.	0
2070	35880	35880	W09-1201	Introduction	18	23	3.0	1.0	This paper is organized as follows.	0
2071	35881	35881	W09-1201	Introduction	19	24	4.0	1.0	Section 2 defines the task, including the format of the data, the evaluation metrics, and the two challenges.	0
2072	35882	35882	W09-1201	Introduction	20	25	4.0	1.0	A substantial portion of the paper (Section 3) is devoted to the description of the conversion and development of the data sets in the additional languages.	0

2076	35886	35886	W09-1201	Introduction	24	29	4.0	1.0	In all sections, we will mention some of the differences between last year's and this year's tasks while keeping the text self-contained whenever possible; for details and observations on the English data, please refer to the overview paper of the CoNLL-2008 Shared Task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) and to the references mentioned in the sections describing the other languages.	0
2077	36304	36304	W10-3001	Task Definitions	1	105	4.0	2.0	Two uncertainty detection tasks (sentence classification and in-sentence hedge scope detection) in two domains (biological publications and Wikipedia articles) with three types of submissions (closed, cross and open) were given to the participants of the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task.	1
2078	36604	36604	W11-1901	Task Description	1	183	1.0	2.0	The CoNLL-2011 shared task was based on the English portion of the OntoNotes 4.0 data.	1
2079	36605	36605	W11-1901	Task Description	2	184	2.0	2.0	The task was to automatically identify mentions of entities and events in text and to link the coreferring mentions together to form entity/event chains.	1
2080	36606	36606	W11-1901	Task Description	3	185	3.0	2.0	The target coreference decisions could be made using automatically predicted information on the other structural layers including the parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named entities.	0
2081	36607	36607	W11-1901	Task Description	4	186	4.0	2.0	As is customary for CoNLL tasks, there were two tracks, closed and open.	0
2082	36608	36608	W11-1901	Task Description	5	187	4.0	2.0	For the closed track, systems were limited to using the distributed resources, in order to allow a fair comparison of algorithm performance, while the open track allowed for almost unrestricted use of external resources in addition to the provided data.	0
2083	37215	37215	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	1	284	1.0	2.0	The CoNLL-2012 shared task was held across all three languages -English, Chinese and Arabicof the OntoNotes v5.0 data.	1
2084	37216	37216	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	2	285	1.0	2.0	The task was to automatically identify mentions of entities and events in text and to link the coreferring mentions together to form entity/event chains.	1
2085	37217	37217	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	3	286	1.0	2.0	The coreference decisions had to be made using automatically predicted information on other structural and semantic layers including the parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named entities.	0
2086	37218	37218	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	4	287	1.0	2.0	Given various factors, such as the lack of resources and state-of-the-art tools, and time constraints, we could not provide some layers of information for the Chinese and Arabic portion of the data.	0
2087	37219	37219	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	5	288	2.0	2.0	The three languages are from quite different language families.	0
2088	37220	37220	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	6	289	2.0	2.0	The morphology of these languages is quite different.	0
2089	37221	37221	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	7	290	2.0	2.0	Arabic has a complex morphology, English has limited morphology, whereas Chinese has very little morphology.	0
2090	37222	37222	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	8	291	2.0	2.0	English word segmentation amounts to rule-based tokenization, and is close to perfect.	0
2091	37223	37223	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	9	292	3.0	2.0	In the case of Chinese and Arabic, although the tokenization/segmentation is not as good as English, the accuracies are in the high 90s.	0
2092	37224	37224	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	10	293	3.0	2.0	Syntactically, there are many dropped subjects and objects in Arabic and Chinese, whereas English is not a pro-drop language.	0
2093	37225	37225	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	11	294	3.0	2.0	Another difference is the amount of resources available for each language.	0
2094	37226	37226	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	12	295	3.0	2.0	English has probably the most resources at its disposal, whereas Chinese and Arabic lack significantly -Arabic more so than Chinese.	0
2095	37227	37227	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	13	296	4.0	2.0	Given this fact, plus the fact that the CoNLL format cannot handle multiple segmentations, and that it would complicate scoring since we are using exact token boundaries (as discussed later in Section 4.5), we decided to allow the use of gold, treebank segmentation for all languages.	0
2096	37228	37228	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	14	297	4.0	2.0	In the case of Chinese, the words themselves are lemmas, so no additional information needs to be provided.	0
2097	37229	37229	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	15	298	4.0	2.0	For Arabic, by default written text is unvocalised, so we decided to also provide correct, gold standard lemmas, along with the correct vocalized version of the tokens.	0
2098	37230	37230	W12-4501	CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task	16	299	4.0	2.0	Table 2 lists which layers were available and quality of the provided layers (when provided.)	0

2131	38461	38461	K16-2001	Task Definition	2	32	1.0	1.0	Specifically, given a newswire article as input, a participating system is asked to return the set of discourse relations it can identify in the text.	1
2132	38462	38462	K16-2001	Task Definition	3	33	1.0	1.0	A discourse relation is defined as a relation taking two abstract objects (events, states, facts, or propositions) as arguments (Prasad et al., 2008;	1
2133	38463	38463	K16-2001	Task Definition	4	34	2.0	1.0	Prasad et al., 2014).	0

2141	38471	38471	K16-2001	Task Definition	12	42	4.0	1.0	A full system that outputs all four components of the discourse relations usually comprises a long pipeline, and it is hard for teams that do not have a pre-existing system to put together a competitive full system.	0

2143	38701	38701	K17-3001	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	Ten years ago, two CoNLL shared tasks were a major milestone for parsing research in general and dependency parsing in particular.	0
2144	38702	38702	K17-3001	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	For the first time dependency treebanks in more than ten languages were available for learning parsers.	0
2145	38703	38703	K17-3001	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	Many of them were used in follow-up work, evaluating parsers on multiple languages became standard, and multiple state-of-the-art, open-source parsers became available, facilitating production of dependency structures to be used in downstream applications.	0
2146	38704	38704	K17-3001	Introduction	4	9	2.0	1.0	While the two tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006;	0
2147	38705	38705	K17-3001	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	Nivre et al., 2007) were extremely important in setting the scene for the following years, there were also limitations that complicated application of their results: (1) gold-standard to-kenization and part-of-speech tags in the test data moved the tasks away from real-world scenarios, and (2) incompatible annotation schemes made cross-linguistic comparison impossible.	0
2148	38706	38706	K17-3001	Introduction	6	11	2.0	1.0	CoNLL 2017 has picked up the threads of those pioneering tasks and addressed these two issues.	0

2150	38708	38708	K17-3001	Introduction	8	13	3.0	1.0	The focus of the 2017 task was learning syntactic dependency parsers that can work in a realworld setting, starting from raw text, and that can work over many typologically different languages, even surprise languages for which there is little or no training data, by exploiting a common syntactic annotation standard.	0
2151	38709	38709	K17-3001	Introduction	9	14	3.0	1.0	This task has been made possible by the Universal Dependencies initiative (UD) (Nivre et al., 2016), which has developed treebanks for 50+ languages with crosslinguistically consistent annotation and recoverability of the original raw texts.	0
2152	38710	38710	K17-3001	Introduction	10	15	4.0	1.0	Participating systems had to find labeled syntactic dependencies between words, i.e., a syntactic head for each word, and a label classifying the type of the dependency relation.	1
2153	38711	38711	K17-3001	Introduction	11	16	4.0	1.0	No gold-standard annotation (tokenization, sentence segmentation, lemmas, morphology) was available in the input text.	0

2156	39002	39002	K18-2001	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	Nivre et al., 2007) and evolved it in two ways: (1) the parsing process started from raw text rather than gold standard tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, and (2) the syntactic representations were consistent across languages thanks to the Universal Dependencies framework (Nivre et al., 2016).	0
2157	39003	39003	K18-2001	Introduction	3	10	2.0	1.0	The 2018 CoNLL shared task on universal dependency parsing starts from the same premises but adds a focus on morphological analysis as well as data from new languages.	0
2158	39004	39004	K18-2001	Introduction	4	11	2.0	1.0	Like last year, participating systems minimally had to find labeled syntactic dependencies between words, i.e., a syntactic head for each word, and a label classifying the type of the dependency relation.	1
2159	39005	39005	K18-2001	Introduction	5	12	3.0	1.0	In addition, this year's task featured new metrics that also scored a system's capacity to predict a morphological analysis of each word, including a part-of-speech tag, morphological features, and a lemma.	1
2160	39006	39006	K18-2001	Introduction	6	13	3.0	1.0	Regardless of metric, the assumption was that the input should be raw text, with no gold-standard word or sentence segmentation, and no gold-standard morphological annotation.	0
2161	39007	39007	K18-2001	Introduction	7	14	4.0	1.0	However, for teams who wanted to concentrate on one or more subtasks, segmentation and morphology predicted by the baseline UDPipe system (Straka et al., 2016) was made available just like last year.	0
2162	39008	39008	K18-2001	Introduction	8	15	4.0	1.0	There are eight new languages this year: Afrikaans, Armenian, Breton, Faroese, Naija, Old French, Serbian, and Thai; see Section 2 for more details.	0
2163	39009	39009	K18-2001	Introduction	9	16	4.0	1.0	The two new evaluation metrics are described in Section 3.	0
2164	39255	39255	K18-3001	Introduction	1	10	1.0	1.0	Some of a word's syntactic and semantic properties are expressed on the word form through a process termed morphological inflection.	0
2165	39256	39256	K18-3001	Introduction	2	11	1.0	1.0	For example, each English count noun has both singular and plural forms (robot/robots, process/processes), known as the inflected forms of the noun.	0
2166	39257	39257	K18-3001	Introduction	3	12	1.0	1.0	Some languages display little inflection, while others possess a proliferation of forms.	0
2167	39258	39258	K18-3001	Introduction	4	13	1.0	1.0	A Polish verb can have nearly 100 inflected forms and an Archi verb has thousands (Kibrik, 1998).	0
2168	39259	39259	K18-3001	Introduction	5	14	2.0	1.0	Natural language processing systems must be able to analyze and generate these inflected forms.	0
2169	39260	39260	K18-3001	Introduction	6	15	2.0	1.0	Fortunately, inflected forms tend to be systematically related to one another.	0
2170	39261	39261	K18-3001	Introduction	7	16	2.0	1.0	This is why English  example maps a lemma and inflection to an inflected form, The inflection is a bundle of morphosyntactic features.	0
2171	39262	39262	K18-3001	Introduction	8	17	2.0	1.0	Note that inflected forms (and lemmata) can encompass multiple words.	0

2176	39267	39267	K18-3001	Introduction	13	22	4.0	1.0	In Task 1, participating systems must inflect word forms based on labeled examples.	1
2177	39268	39268	K18-3001	Introduction	14	23	4.0	1.0	In English, an example of inflection is the conversion of a citation form 1 run to its present participle, running.	1
2178	39269	39269	K18-3001	Introduction	15	24	4.0	1.0	The system is provided with the source form and the morphosyntactic description (MSD) of the target form, and must generate the actual target form.	1
2179	39270	39270	K18-3001	Introduction	16	25	4.0	1.0	Task 2 is a harder version of Task 1, where the system must infer the appropriate MSD from a sentential context.	1
2180	39271	39271	K18-3001	Introduction	17	26	4.0	1.0	This is essentially a cloze task, asking participants to provide the correct form of a lemma in context.	0
2181	39561	39561	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	1	6	1.0	1.0	All things semantic are receiving heightened attention in recent years, and despite remarkable advances in vector-based (continuous and distributed) encodings of meaning, 'classic' (discrete and hierarchically structured) semantic representations will continue to play an important role in 'making sense' of natural language.	0
2182	39562	39562	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	2	7	1.0	1.0	While parsing has long been dominated by tree-structured target representations, there is now growing interest in general graphs as more expressive and arguably more adequate target structures for sentence-level analysis beyond surface syntax, and in particular for the representation of semantic structure.	0
2183	39563	39563	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	3	8	1.0	1.0	The 2019 Conference on Computational Language Learning (CoNLL) hosts a shared task (or 'system bake-off') on Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP 2019).	0
2184	39564	39564	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	4	9	1.0	1.0	The goal of the task is to advance data-driven parsing into graph-structured representations of sentence meaning.	0
2185	39565	39565	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	5	10	2.0	1.0	For the first time, this task combines formally and linguistically different approaches to meaning representation in graph form in a uniform training and evaluation setup.	0
2186	39566	39566	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	6	11	2.0	1.0	Participants were invited to develop parsing systems that support five distinct semantic graph frameworks (see §3 below)which all encode core predicate-argument structure, among other things-in the same implementation.	1
2187	39567	39567	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	7	12	2.0	1.0	Ideally, these parsers predict sentence-level meaning representations in all frameworks in parallel.	1
2188	39568	39568	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	8	13	2.0	1.0	Architectures utilizing complementary knowledge sources (e.g. via parameter sharing) were encouraged, though not required.	0
2189	39569	39569	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	9	14	3.0	1.0	Learning from multiple flavors of meaning representation in tandem has hardly been explored (with notable exceptions, e.g. the parsers of Peng et al., 2017;	0
2190	39570	39570	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	10	15	3.0	1.0	Hershcovich et al., 2018;or Stanovsky and Dagan, 2018).	0

2192	39572	39572	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	12	17	3.0	1.0	The task design aims to reduce framework-specific 'balkanization' in the field of meaning representation parsing.	0
2193	39573	39573	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	13	18	4.0	1.0	Its contributions include (a) a unifying formal model over different semantic graph banks ( §2), (b) uniform representations and scoring ( §4 and §6), (c) contrastive evaluation across frameworks ( §5), and (d) increased cross-fertilization via transfer and multi-task learning ( §7).	0
2194	39574	39574	K19-2001	Background and Motivation	14	19	4.0	1.0	Thus, the task engages the combined community of parser developers for graph-structured output representations, including from prior framework-specific tasks at the Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) exercises between 2014 and 2019 May, 2016;	0

2305	41197	41197	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	27	35	4.0	1.0	In contrast, detecting and predicting empathy and distress in text is a growing field and there is little work on the correlation and relatedness of emotion, empathy, and distress.	0
2306	41198	41198	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	28	36	4.0	1.0	This shared task is designed to study the modeling of empathy and distress and the correlation among them.	0
2307	41199	41199	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	29	37	4.0	1.0	In the literature empathy is considered towards negative events, however, recent studies suggest that people's joyful emotions towards positive events can be termed as positive empathy (Morelli et al., 2015).	0
2308	41200	41200	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	30	38	4.0	1.0	The psychological theory distinguishes two separate constructs for distress and empathy; distress is a self-focused, negative affective state (suffering with someone), and empathy is a warm, tender, and compassionate state (feeling for someone).	0
2309	41201	41201	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	31	39	4.0	1.0	To quantify empathy and distress, studies present different approaches, the most popular one is Batson's Empathic Concern -Personal Distress Scale (Batson et al., 1987), which is used to obtain empathy and distress scores for each essay in this dataset.	0
2310	41202	41202	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	32	40	4.0	1.0	To annotate emotions in text, classical studies in NLP suggest categorical tagsets, and most studies are focused on basic emotion models that are suggested by psychological emotion models.	0
2311	41203	41203	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	33	41	4.0	1.0	The most popular ones are the Ekman 6 basic emotions (Ekman, 1971), the Plutchik 8 basic emotions (Plutchik, 1984), and 4 basic emotions (Frijda, 1988).	0
2312	41204	41204	2021.wassa-1.10	Introduction	34	42	4.0	1.0	We opted for the Ekman emotions, because this model is well adopted in different downstream NLP tasks of which emotion is a component, and it is most suited to the dataset we aim to study in this shared task.	0

2315	41707	41707	W18-6206	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Past shared tasks on emotions use data with both overt expressions of emotions (I am so happy to see you!) as well as subtle expressions where the emotions have to be inferred, for instance from event descriptions.	0
2316	41708	41708	W18-6206	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	Further, most datasets do not focus on the cause or the stimulus of the emotion.	0
2317	41709	41709	W18-6206	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Here, for the first time, we propose a shared task where systems have to predict the emotions in a large automatically labeled dataset of tweets without access to words denoting emotions.	1
2318	41710	41710	W18-6206	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Based on this intention, we call this the Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST) because the systems have to infer the emotion mostly from the context.	0
2319	41711	41711	W18-6206	abstract	5	6	2.0	1.0	Every tweet has an occurrence of an explicit emotion word that is masked.	0
2320	41712	41712	W18-6206	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	The tweets are collected in a manner such that they are likely to include a description of the cause of the emotion -the stimulus.	0

2460	43903	43903	W18-0604	Introduction	10	16	2.0	1.0	While such research is valuable, predictions about the long-term future can aid with another class of applications: the understanding of early life markers and development of preventative care.	0
2461	43904	43904	W18-0604	Introduction	11	17	2.0	1.0	Here we describe the CLPsych 2018 shared task, the purpose of which is to evaluate multiple methods for analyzing linguistic markers as a signal for current and future psychological outcomes (i.e. risk assessment).	1

2553	46372	46372	W11-1804	Introduction	3	8	2.0	1.0	The primary target of the task is event extraction , broadly following the task setup of the BioNLP'09 Shared Task (BioNLP ST'09) .	0
2554	46373	46373	W11-1804	Introduction	4	9	2.0	1.0	The task concentrates on the specific domain of two-component systems (TCSs, or two-component regulatory systems), a mechanism widely used by bacteria to sense and respond to the environment (Thomason and Kay, 2000).	0
2555	46374	46374	W11-1804	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	Typical TCSs consist of two proteins, a membrane-associated sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator.	0
2556	46375	46375	W11-1804	Introduction	6	11	3.0	1.0	The sensor kinase monitors changes in the environment while the response regulator mediates an adaptive response, usually through differential expression of target genes (Mascher et al., 2006).	0
2557	46376	46376	W11-1804	Introduction	7	12	3.0	1.0	TCSs have many functions, but those of particular interest for infectious disease researchers include virulence, response to antibiotics, quorum sensing, and bacterial cell attachment (Krell et al., 2010).	0
2558	46377	46377	W11-1804	Introduction	8	13	3.0	1.0	Not all TCS functions are well known: in some cases, TCSs are involved in metabolic processes that are difficult to precisely characterize (Wang et al., 2010).	0
2559	46378	46378	W11-1804	Introduction	9	14	4.0	1.0	TCSs are of interest also as drugs designed to disrupt TCSs may reduce the virulence of bacteria without killing it, thus avoiding the potential selective pressure of antibiotics lethal to some pathogenic bacteria (Gotoh et al., 2010).	0
2560	46379	46379	W11-1804	Introduction	10	15	4.0	1.0	Information extraction techniques may support better understanding of these fundamental systems by identifying and structuring the molecular processes underlying two component signaling.	0
2561	46380	46380	W11-1804	Introduction	11	16	4.0	1.0	The ID task seeks to address these opportunities by adapting the BioNLP ST'09 event extraction model to domain scientific publications.	0
2562	46381	46381	W11-1804	Introduction	12	17	4.0	1.0	This model was originally introduced to represent biomolecular events relating to transcription factors in human blood cells, and its adaptation to a domain that centrally concerns both bacteria and their hosts involves a variety of novel aspects, such as events concerning whole organisms, the chemical environment of bacteria, prokaryote-specific concepts (e.g. regulons as elements of gene expression), as well as the effects of biomolecules on larger-scale processes involving hosts such as virulence.	0
