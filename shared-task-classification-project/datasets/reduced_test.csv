1	2094	2094	S07-2	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledgebased systems.	0
2	2095	2095	S07-2	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	In total there were 6 participating systems.	0
3	2096	2096	S07-2	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	We reused the SemEval-2007 English lexical sample subtask of task 17, and set up both clustering-style unsupervised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping).	0
4	2097	2097	S07-2	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	We provide a comparison to the results of the systems participating in the lexical sample subtask of task 17.	0
5	2098	2098	S07-2	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling-technology.	0
6	2099	2099	S07-2	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	Supervised WSD techniques are the best performing in public evaluations, but need large amounts of hand-tagging data.	0
7	2100	2100	S07-2	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).	0
8	2101	2101	S07-2	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	In theory, larger amounts of training data (SemCor has approx.	0
9	2102	2102	S07-2	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	500M words) would improve the performance of supervised WSD, but no current project exists to provide such an expensive resource.	0
10	2103	2103	S07-2	Introduction	6	11	2.0	1.0	Another problem of the supervised approach is that the inventory and distribution of senses changes dramatically from one domain to the other, requiring additional hand-tagging of corpora (Martínez and Agirre, 2000;	0
11	2104	2104	S07-2	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	Koeling et al., 2005).	0
12	2105	2105	S07-2	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	"Supervised WSD is based on the ""fixed-list of senses"" paradigm, where the senses for a target word are a closed list coming from a dictionary or lexicon."	0
13	2106	2106	S07-2	Introduction	9	14	2.0	1.0	Lexicographers and semanticists have long warned about the problems of such an approach, where senses are listed separately as discrete entities, and have argued in favor of more complex representations, where, for instance, senses are dense regions in a continuum (Cruse, 2000).	0
14	2107	2107	S07-2	Introduction	10	15	3.0	1.0	Unsupervised Word Sense Induction and Discrimination (WSID, also known as corpus-based unsupervised systems) has followed this line of thinking, and tries to induce word senses directly from the corpus.	1
15	2108	2108	S07-2	Introduction	11	16	3.0	1.0	Typical WSID systems involve clustering techniques, which group together similar examples.	0
16	2109	2109	S07-2	Introduction	12	17	3.0	1.0	Given a set of induced clusters (which represent word uses or senses 1 ), each new occurrence of the target word will be compared to the clusters and the most similar cluster will be selected as its sense.	0
17	2110	2110	S07-2	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	One of the problems of unsupervised systems is that of managing to do a fair evaluation.	0
18	2111	2111	S07-2	Introduction	14	19	3.0	1.0	Most of current unsupervised systems are evaluated in-house, with a brief comparison to a re-implementation of a former system, leading to a proliferation of unsupervised systems with little ground to compare among them.	0
19	2112	2112	S07-2	Introduction	15	20	4.0	1.0	The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledge-based systems.	0

43	5289	5289	S10-12	Introduction	14	18	1.0	1.0	Focusing on a natural human competence makes it practical to collect high quality evaluation data from untrained annotators.	0
44	5290	5290	S10-12	Introduction	15	19	1.0	1.0	The PETE dataset was annotated by untrained Amazon Mechanical Turk workers at an insignificant cost and each annotation is based on the unanimous agreement of at least three workers.	0
45	5291	5291	S10-12	Introduction	16	20	2.0	1.0	In contrast, of the 36306 constituent strings that appear multiple times in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994), 5646 (15%) have multiple conflicting annotations.	0
46	5292	5292	S10-12	Introduction	17	21	2.0	1.0	If indicative of the general level of inconsistency, 15% is a very high number given that the state of the art parsers claim f-scores above 90% (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).	0
47	5293	5293	S10-12	Introduction	18	22	2.0	1.0	Relevance: PETE automatically focuses attention on semantically relevant phenomena rather than differences in annotation style or linguistic convention.	0

50	5296	5296	S10-12	Introduction	21	25	2.0	1.0	Standard treebank based evaluation metrics do not distinguish between semantically relevant and irrelevant errors (Bonnema et al., 1997).	0
51	5297	5297	S10-12	Introduction	22	26	2.0	1.0	In PETE semantically relevant differences lead to different entailments, semantically irrelevant differences do not.	0
52	5298	5298	S10-12	Introduction	23	27	2.0	1.0	Framework independence: Entailment recognition is a formalism independent task.	0
53	5299	5299	S10-12	Introduction	24	28	2.0	1.0	A common evaluation method for parsers that do not use the Penn Treebank formalism is to automatically convert the Penn Treebank to the appropriate formalism and to perform treebank based evaluation (Nivre et al., 2007a;	0
54	5300	5300	S10-12	Introduction	25	29	2.0	1.0	Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).	0
55	5301	5301	S10-12	Introduction	26	30	2.0	1.0	The inevitable conversion errors compound the already mentioned problems of treebank based evaluation.	0
56	5302	5302	S10-12	Introduction	27	31	2.0	1.0	In addition, manually designed treebanks do not naturally lend themselves to unsupervised parser evaluation.	0
57	5303	5303	S10-12	Introduction	28	32	2.0	1.0	Unlike treebank based evaluation, PETE can compare phrase structure parsers, dependency parsers, unsupervised parsers and other approaches on an equal footing.	0
58	5304	5304	S10-12	Introduction	29	33	2.0	1.0	PETE was inspired by earlier work on representations of grammatical dependency, proposed for ease of use by end users and suitable for parser evaluation.	0
59	5305	5305	S10-12	Introduction	30	34	2.0	1.0	These include the grammatical relations (GR) by (Carroll et al., 1999), the PARC representation (King et al., 2003), and Stanford typed dependencies (SD) (De Marneffe et al., 2006) (See (Bos and others, 2008) for other proposals).	0
60	5306	5306	S10-12	Introduction	31	35	3.0	1.0	Each use a set of binary relations between words in a sentence as the primary unit of representation.	0
61	5307	5307	S10-12	Introduction	32	36	3.0	1.0	They share some common motivations: usability by people who are not (computational) linguists and suitability for relation extraction applications.	0

69	5315	5315	S10-12	Introduction	40	44	3.0	2.0	PETE has some advantages over representations based on grammatical relations.	0
70	5316	5316	S10-12	Introduction	41	45	3.0	2.0	For example SD defines 55 relations organized in a hierarchy, and it may be non-trivial for a non-linguist to understand the difference between ccomp (clausal complement with internal subject) and xcomp (clausal complement with external subject) or between nsubj (nominal subject) and xsubj (controlling subject).	0
71	5317	5317	S10-12	Introduction	42	46	3.0	2.0	In fact it could be argued that proposals like SD replace one artificial annotation formalism with another and no two such proposals agree on the ideal set of binary relations to use.	0
72	5318	5318	S10-12	Introduction	43	47	3.0	2.0	In contrast, untrained annotators have no difficulty unanimously agreeing on the validity of most PETE type entailments.	0
73	5319	5319	S10-12	Introduction	44	48	3.0	2.0	However there are also significant challenges associated with an evaluation scheme like PETE.	0
74	5320	5320	S10-12	Introduction	45	49	3.0	2.0	It is not always clear how to convert certain relations into grammatical hypothesis sentences without including most of the original sentence in the hypothesis.	0
75	5321	5321	S10-12	Introduction	46	50	4.0	2.0	Including too much of the sentence in the hypothesis would increase the chances of getting the right answer with the wrong parse.	0
76	5322	5322	S10-12	Introduction	47	51	4.0	2.0	Grammatical hypothesis sentences are especially difficult to construct when a (negative) entailment is based on a bad parse of the sentence.	0
77	5323	5323	S10-12	Introduction	48	52	4.0	2.0	"Introducing dummy words like ""someone"" or ""something"" alleviates part of the problem but does not help in the case of clausal complements."	0
78	5324	5324	S10-12	Introduction	49	53	4.0	2.0	In summary, PETE makes the annotation phase more practical and consistent but shifts the difficulty to the entailment creation phase.	0
79	5325	5325	S10-12	Introduction	50	54	4.0	2.0	PETE gets closer to an extrinsic evaluation by focusing on semantically relevant, application oriented differences that can be expressed in natural language sentences.	0
80	5326	5326	S10-12	Introduction	51	55	4.0	2.0	This makes the evaluation procedure indirect: a parser developer has to write an extension that can handle entailment questions.	0
81	5327	5327	S10-12	Introduction	52	56	4.0	2.0	However, given the simplicity of the entailments, the complexity of such an extension is comparable to one that extracts grammatical relations.	0
82	5328	5328	S10-12	Introduction	53	57	4.0	2.0	The balance of what is being evaluated is also important.	0
83	5329	5329	S10-12	Introduction	54	58	4.0	2.0	A treebank based evaluation scheme may mix semantically relevant and irrelevant mistakes, but at least it covers every sentence at a uniform level of detail.	0
84	5330	5330	S10-12	Introduction	55	59	4.0	2.0	In this evaluation, we focused on sentences and relations where state of the art parsers disagree.	0
85	5331	5331	S10-12	Introduction	56	60	4.0	2.0	We hope this methodology will uncover weaknesses that the next generation systems can focus on.	0

91	5839	5839	S10-18	Task Set up 2.1 Task description	1	31	1.0	1.0	In this task, we focus on 14 frequently used sentiment ambiguous adjectives in Chinese, which all have the meaning of measurement, as shown below.	0

93	5841	5841	S10-18	Task Set up 2.1 Task description	3	33	2.0	1.0	These adjectives are neutral out of context, but when they co-occur with some target nouns, positive or negative emotion will be evoked.	0
94	5842	5842	S10-18	Task Set up 2.1 Task description	4	34	2.0	1.0	Although the number of such ambiguous adjectives is not large, they are frequently used in real text, especially in the texts expressing opinions and emotions.	0
95	5843	5843	S10-18	Task Set up 2.1 Task description	5	35	3.0	1.0	The task is designed to automatically determine the SO of these sentiment ambiguous adjectives within context: positive or negative.	1

99	7084	7084	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	1	106	1.0	3.0	Given two sentences, s1 and s2, an STS system would need to return a similarity score.	1
100	7085	7085	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	2	107	1.0	3.0	Participants can also provide a confidence score indicating their confidence level for the result returned for each pair, but this confidence is not used for the main results.	1
101	7086	7086	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	3	108	2.0	3.0	The output of the systems performance is evaluated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the system scores and the human scores, as customary in text similarity (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965).	0
102	7087	7087	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	4	109	2.0	3.0	We calculated Pearson for each evaluation dataset separately.	0
103	7088	7088	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	5	110	2.0	3.0	In order to have a single Pearson measure for each system we concatenated the gold standard (and system outputs) for all 5 datasets into a single gold stan-dard file (and single system output).	0
104	7089	7089	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	6	111	3.0	3.0	The first version of the results were published using this method, but the overall score did not correspond well to the individual scores in the datasets, and participants proposed two additional evaluation metrics, both of them based on Pearson correlation.	0
105	7090	7090	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	7	112	3.0	3.0	The organizers of the task decided that it was more informative, and on the benefit of the community, to also adopt those evaluation metrics, and the idea of having a single main evaluation metric was dropped.	0
106	7091	7091	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	8	113	4.0	3.0	This decision was not without controversy, but the organizers gave more priority to openness and inclusiveness and to the involvement of participants.	0
107	7092	7092	S12-6	Systems Evaluation	9	114	4.0	3.0	The final result table thus included three evaluation metrics.	0

109	8124	8124	S13-5	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	Numerous past tasks have focused on leveraging the meaning of word types or words in context.	0
110	8125	8125	S13-5	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	Examples of the former are noun categorization and the TOEFL test, examples of the latter are word sense disambiguation, metonymy resolution, and lexical substitution.	0
111	8126	8126	S13-5	Introduction	3	9	1.0	1.0	As these tasks have enjoyed a lot success, a natural progression is the pursuit of models that can perform similar tasks taking into account multiword expressions and complex compositional structure.	0
112	8127	8127	S13-5	Introduction	4	10	1.0	1.0	In this paper, we present two subtasks designed to evaluate such phrasal models: a. Semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases b.	1
113	8128	8128	S13-5	Introduction	5	11	1.0	1.0	Evaluating the compositionality of phrases in context	1
114	8129	8129	S13-5	Introduction	6	12	2.0	1.0	"For example, the first subtask addresses computing how similar the word ""valuation"" is to the compositional sequence ""price assessment"", while the second subtask addresses deciding whether the phrase ""piece of cake"" is used literally or figuratively in the sentence ""Labour was a piece of cake!""."	0
115	8130	8130	S13-5	Introduction	7	13	2.0	1.0	The aim of these subtasks is two-fold.	0
116	8131	8131	S13-5	Introduction	8	14	2.0	1.0	Firstly, considering that there is a spread interest lately in phrasal semantics in its various guises, they provide an opportunity to draw together approaches to numerous related problems under a common evaluation set.	0
117	8132	8132	S13-5	Introduction	9	15	2.0	1.0	It is intended that after the competition, the evaluation setting and the datasets will comprise an on-going benchmark for the evaluation of these phrasal models.	0

121	8136	8136	S13-5	Introduction	13	19	3.0	1.0	Bridging the gap between lexical semantics and linguistic inference could provoke novel approaches to certain established tasks, such as lexical entailment and paraphrase identification.	0
122	8137	8137	S13-5	Introduction	14	20	3.0	1.0	In addition, it could ul-timately lead to improvements in a wide range of applications in natural language processing, such as document retrieval, clustering and classification, question answering, query expansion, synonym extraction, relation extraction, automatic translation, or textual advertisement matching in search engines, all of which depend on phrasal semantics.	0

160	13719	13719	S15-13	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL) are well-known problems in the Natural Language Processing field and both address the lexical ambiguity of language.	0
161	13720	13720	S15-13	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	Their main difference lies in the kind of meaning inventories that are used: EL uses encyclopedic knowledge, while WSD uses lexicographic information.	0
162	13721	13721	S15-13	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	Our aim with this task is to analyze whether, and if so, how, using a resource that integrates both kinds of inventories (i.e., BabelNet 2.5.1) might enable WSD and EL to be solved by means of similar (even, the same) methods.	0
