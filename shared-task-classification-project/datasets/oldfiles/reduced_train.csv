8361	8361	S13-7	Introduction	36	42	0.72	0.161538461538462	System designers typically create a repertoire of questions that the system can ask a student, together with reference answers (see Figure 1 for an example).	0
8362	8362	S13-7	Introduction	37	43	0.74	0.165384615384615	For each student answer, the system needs to decide on the appropriate tutorial feedback, either confirming that the answer was correct, or providing additional help to indicate how the answer is flawed and help the student improve.	1
8363	8363	S13-7	Introduction	38	44	0.76	0.169230769230769	This task requires semantic inference, for example, to detect when the student answers are explaining the same content but in different words, or when they are contradicting the reference answers.	0

13357	13357	S15-10	Conclusion	1	252	0.125	0.972972972972973	We have described the five subtasks organized as part of SemEval-2015 Task 10 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter: detecting sentiment of terms in context (subtask A), classifiying the sentiment of an entire tweet, SMS message or blog post (subtask B), predicting polarity towards a topic (subtask C), quantifying polarity towards a topic (subtask D), and proposing real-valued prior sentiment scores for Twitter terms (subtask E).	1

13359	13359	S15-10	Conclusion	3	254	0.375	0.980694980694981	We plan a new edition of the task as part of SemEval-2016, where we will focus on sentiment with respect to a topic, but this time on a fivepoint scale, which is used for human review ratings on popular websites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.	0
13360	13360	S15-10	Conclusion	4	255	0.5	0.984555984555985	From a research perspective, moving to an ordered five-point scale means moving from binary classification to ordinal regression.	0
13361	13361	S15-10	Conclusion	5	256	0.625	0.988416988416988	We further plan to continue the trend detection subtask, which represents a move from classification to quantification, and is on par with what applications need.	0

13402	13402	S15-11	Task Description	3	38	0.428571428571429	0.267605633802817	Since irony and sarcasm are typically used to criticize or to mock, and thus skew the perception of sentiment toward the negative, it is not enough for a system to simply determine whether the sentiment of a given tweet is positive or negative.	0

13404	13404	S15-11	Task Description	5	40	0.714285714285714	0.28169014084507	The point 0 on this scale is used for neutral tweets, or those whose positivity and negativity cancel each other out.	0
13405	13405	S15-11	Task Description	6	41	0.857142857142857	0.288732394366197	While the majority of tweets will have sentiments in the negative part of the scale, the challenge for participating systems is to decide just how negative or positive a tweet seems to be.	0
13406	13406	S15-11	Task Description	7	42	1.0	0.295774647887324	So, given a set of tweets that are rich in metaphor, sarcasm and irony, the goal is to determine whether a user has expressed a positive, negative or neutral sentiment in each, and the degree to which this sentiment has been communicated.	1
