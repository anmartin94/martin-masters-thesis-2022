9053	9053	S13-11	Introduction	1	5	0.05	0.038167938931298	Word ambiguity is a pervasive issue in Natural Language Processing.	0
9054	9054	S13-11	Introduction	2	6	0.1	0.045801526717557	Two main techniques in computational lexical semantics, i.e., Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Word Sense Induction (WSI) address this issue from different perspectives: the former is aimed at assigning word senses from a predefined sense inventory to words in context, whereas the latter automatically identifies the meanings of a word of interest by clustering the contexts in which it occurs (see (Navigli, 2009;	0
9055	9055	S13-11	Introduction	3	7	0.15	0.053435114503817	Navigli, 2012) for a survey).	0
9056	9056	S13-11	Introduction	4	8	0.2	0.061068702290076	Unfortunately, the paradigms of both WSD and WSI suffer from significant issues which hamper their success in real-world applications.	0
9057	9057	S13-11	Introduction	5	9	0.25	0.068702290076336	In fact, the performance of WSD systems depends heavily on which sense inventory is chosen.	0
9058	9058	S13-11	Introduction	6	10	0.3	0.076335877862596	For instance, the most popular computational lexicon of English, i.e., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides fine-grained distinctions which make the disambiguation task quite difficult even for humans (Edmonds and Kilgarriff, 2002;	0
9059	9059	S13-11	Introduction	7	11	0.35	0.083969465648855	Snyder and Palmer, 2004), although disagreements can be solved to some extent with graph-based methods (Navigli, 2008).	0
9060	9060	S13-11	Introduction	8	12	0.4	0.091603053435115	On the other hand, although WSI overcomes this issue by allowing unrestrained sets of senses, its evaluation is particularly arduous because there is no easy way of comparing and ranking different representations of senses.	0
9061	9061	S13-11	Introduction	9	13	0.45	0.099236641221374	In fact, all the proposed measures in the literature tend to favour specific cluster shapes (e.g., singletons or all-in-one clusters) of the senses produced as output.	0
9062	9062	S13-11	Introduction	10	14	0.5	0.106870229007634	Indeed, WSI evaluation is actually an instance of the more general and difficult problem of evaluating clustering algorithms.	0
9063	9063	S13-11	Introduction	11	15	0.55	0.114503816793893	Nonetheless, many everyday tasks carried out by online users would benefit from intelligent systems able to address the lexical ambiguity issue effectively.	0
9064	9064	S13-11	Introduction	12	16	0.6	0.122137404580153	A case in point is Web information retrieval, a task which is becoming increasingly difficult given the continuously growing pool of Web text of the most wildly disparate kinds.	0
9065	9065	S13-11	Introduction	13	17	0.65	0.129770992366412	Recent work has addressed this issue by proposing a general evaluation framework for injecting WSI into Web search result clustering and diversification (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010;	0

9068	9068	S13-11	Introduction	16	20	0.8	0.152671755725191	The Semeval-2013 task described in this paper 1 adopts the evaluation framework of Di Marco and Navigli (2013), and extends it to both WSD and WSI systems.	0
9069	9069	S13-11	Introduction	17	21	0.85	0.16030534351145	The task is aimed at overcoming the wellknown limitations of in vitro evaluations, such as those of previous SemEval tasks on the topic (Agirre and Soroa, 2007;Manandhar et al., 2010), and enabling a fair comparison between the two disambiguation paradigms.	0
9070	9070	S13-11	Introduction	18	22	0.9	0.16793893129771	Key to our framework is the assumption that search results grouped into a given cluster are semantically related to each other and that each cluster is expected to represent a specific meaning of the input query (even though it is possible for more than one cluster to represent the same meaning).	0

26489	26489	S20-5	Related Work	7	199	0.4375	0.87280701754386	In contrast to the statements collected from tweets, which have a very large portion that are open-ended, vague thoughts, the counterfactuals in our dataset are more meaningful domain-related statements.	0
26490	26490	S20-5	Related Work	8	200	0.5	0.87719298245614	There is another dataset TIMETRAVEL proposed in (Qin et al., 2019)  in which given a short story and an alternative counterfactual event context, the story needs to be minimally revised to keep compatible with the intervening counterfactual event.	0
26491	26491	S20-5	Related Work	9	201	0.5625	0.881578947368421	The empirical results show that it is still challenging for current neural language models to perform well on the counterfactual story rewriting task due to the lack of counterfactual reasoning capabilities.	0

26493	26493	S20-5	Related Work	11	203	0.6875	0.890350877192982	Researchers argue that the notion of counterfactuals is essential for causal reasoning, in which causal modeling is proposed to interpret counterfactual conditionals in natural language, and such work has been discussed since the possible worlds semantics developed in the 1970s (Lewis, 2013;	0
