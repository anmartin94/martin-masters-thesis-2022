1	1	1	S01-basque	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	In this paper we describe the Senseval 2 Basque lexical-sample task.	0
2	2	2	S01-basque	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	The task comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 10 adjectives) selected from Euskal Hiztegia, the main Basque dictionary.	0
3	3	3	S01-basque	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Most examples were taken from the Egunkaria newspaper.	0
4	4	4	S01-basque	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	The method used to hand-tag the examples produced low inter-tagger agreement (75%) before arbitration.	0

13	2093	2093	S07-2	title	1	1	4.0	1.0	Semeval-2007 Task 02: Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems	1
14	2094	2094	S07-2	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledgebased systems.	0
15	2095	2095	S07-2	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	In total there were 6 participating systems.	0
16	2096	2096	S07-2	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	We reused the SemEval-2007 English lexical sample subtask of task 17, and set up both clustering-style unsupervised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping).	0
17	2097	2097	S07-2	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	We provide a comparison to the results of the systems participating in the lexical sample subtask of task 17.	0
18	2098	2098	S07-2	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling-technology.	0
19	2099	2099	S07-2	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	Supervised WSD techniques are the best performing in public evaluations, but need large amounts of hand-tagging data.	0
20	2100	2100	S07-2	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).	0
21	2101	2101	S07-2	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	In theory, larger amounts of training data (SemCor has approx.	0
22	2102	2102	S07-2	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	500M words) would improve the performance of supervised WSD, but no current project exists to provide such an expensive resource.	0
23	2103	2103	S07-2	Introduction	6	11	2.0	1.0	Another problem of the supervised approach is that the inventory and distribution of senses changes dramatically from one domain to the other, requiring additional hand-tagging of corpora (Martínez and Agirre, 2000;	0
24	2104	2104	S07-2	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	Koeling et al., 2005).	0
25	2105	2105	S07-2	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	"Supervised WSD is based on the ""fixed-list of senses"" paradigm, where the senses for a target word are a closed list coming from a dictionary or lexicon."	0
26	2106	2106	S07-2	Introduction	9	14	2.0	1.0	Lexicographers and semanticists have long warned about the problems of such an approach, where senses are listed separately as discrete entities, and have argued in favor of more complex representations, where, for instance, senses are dense regions in a continuum (Cruse, 2000).	0
27	2107	2107	S07-2	Introduction	10	15	3.0	1.0	Unsupervised Word Sense Induction and Discrimination (WSID, also known as corpus-based unsupervised systems) has followed this line of thinking, and tries to induce word senses directly from the corpus.	1
28	2108	2108	S07-2	Introduction	11	16	3.0	1.0	Typical WSID systems involve clustering techniques, which group together similar examples.	0
29	2109	2109	S07-2	Introduction	12	17	3.0	1.0	Given a set of induced clusters (which represent word uses or senses 1 ), each new occurrence of the target word will be compared to the clusters and the most similar cluster will be selected as its sense.	0
30	2110	2110	S07-2	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	One of the problems of unsupervised systems is that of managing to do a fair evaluation.	0
31	2111	2111	S07-2	Introduction	14	19	3.0	1.0	Most of current unsupervised systems are evaluated in-house, with a brief comparison to a re-implementation of a former system, leading to a proliferation of unsupervised systems with little ground to compare among them.	0
32	2112	2112	S07-2	Introduction	15	20	4.0	1.0	The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledge-based systems.	0

37	2247	2247	S07-2	Conclusions	1	155	1.0	4.0	We have presented the design and results of the SemEval-2007 task 02 on evaluating word sense induction and discrimination systems.	0
38	2248	2248	S07-2	Conclusions	2	156	1.0	4.0	6 systems participated, but one of them was not a sense induction system.	0
39	2249	2249	S07-2	Conclusions	3	157	2.0	4.0	We reused the data from the SemEval-2007 English lexical sample subtask of task 17, and set up both clustering-style unsupervised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the training part of the dataset for mapping).	0
40	2250	2250	S07-2	Conclusions	4	158	2.0	4.0	We also provide a comparison to the results of the systems participating in the lexical sample subtask of task 17.	0
41	2251	2251	S07-2	Conclusions	5	159	3.0	4.0	Evaluating clustering solutions is not straightforward.	0
42	2252	2252	S07-2	Conclusions	6	160	3.0	4.0	The unsupervised evaluation seems to be sensitive to the number of senses in the gold standard, and the coarse grained sense inventory used in the gold standard had a great impact in the results.	0
43	2253	2253	S07-2	Conclusions	7	161	4.0	4.0	The supervised evaluation introduces a mapping step which interacts with the clustering solution.	0
44	2254	2254	S07-2	Conclusions	8	162	4.0	4.0	In fact, the ranking of the participating systems 3 All systems in the case of a random train/test split varies according to the evaluation method used.	0
45	2255	2255	S07-2	Conclusions	9	163	4.0	4.0	We think the two evaluation results should be taken to be complementary regarding the information learned by the clustering systems, and that the evaluation of word sense induction and discrimination systems needs further developments, perhaps linked to a certain application or purpose.	0

58	2827	2827	S07-9	Introduction	9	13	3.0	1.0	We presented all the annotation levels together as a complex global task, since we were interested in approaches which address these problems jointly, possibly taking into account cross-dependencies among them.	0

91	5299	5299	S10-12	Introduction	24	28	2.0	1.0	A common evaluation method for parsers that do not use the Penn Treebank formalism is to automatically convert the Penn Treebank to the appropriate formalism and to perform treebank based evaluation (Nivre et al., 2007a;	0
92	5300	5300	S10-12	Introduction	25	29	2.0	1.0	Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).	0
93	5301	5301	S10-12	Introduction	26	30	2.0	1.0	The inevitable conversion errors compound the already mentioned problems of treebank based evaluation.	0
94	5302	5302	S10-12	Introduction	27	31	2.0	1.0	In addition, manually designed treebanks do not naturally lend themselves to unsupervised parser evaluation.	0
95	5303	5303	S10-12	Introduction	28	32	2.0	1.0	Unlike treebank based evaluation, PETE can compare phrase structure parsers, dependency parsers, unsupervised parsers and other approaches on an equal footing.	0
96	5304	5304	S10-12	Introduction	29	33	2.0	1.0	PETE was inspired by earlier work on representations of grammatical dependency, proposed for ease of use by end users and suitable for parser evaluation.	0
97	5305	5305	S10-12	Introduction	30	34	2.0	1.0	These include the grammatical relations (GR) by (Carroll et al., 1999), the PARC representation (King et al., 2003), and Stanford typed dependencies (SD) (De Marneffe et al., 2006) (See (Bos and others, 2008) for other proposals).	0

107	5315	5315	S10-12	Introduction	40	44	3.0	2.0	PETE has some advantages over representations based on grammatical relations.	0
108	5316	5316	S10-12	Introduction	41	45	3.0	2.0	For example SD defines 55 relations organized in a hierarchy, and it may be non-trivial for a non-linguist to understand the difference between ccomp (clausal complement with internal subject) and xcomp (clausal complement with external subject) or between nsubj (nominal subject) and xsubj (controlling subject).	0
109	5317	5317	S10-12	Introduction	42	46	3.0	2.0	In fact it could be argued that proposals like SD replace one artificial annotation formalism with another and no two such proposals agree on the ideal set of binary relations to use.	0
110	5318	5318	S10-12	Introduction	43	47	3.0	2.0	In contrast, untrained annotators have no difficulty unanimously agreeing on the validity of most PETE type entailments.	0
111	5319	5319	S10-12	Introduction	44	48	3.0	2.0	However there are also significant challenges associated with an evaluation scheme like PETE.	0
112	5320	5320	S10-12	Introduction	45	49	3.0	2.0	It is not always clear how to convert certain relations into grammatical hypothesis sentences without including most of the original sentence in the hypothesis.	0
113	5321	5321	S10-12	Introduction	46	50	4.0	2.0	Including too much of the sentence in the hypothesis would increase the chances of getting the right answer with the wrong parse.	0
114	5322	5322	S10-12	Introduction	47	51	4.0	2.0	Grammatical hypothesis sentences are especially difficult to construct when a (negative) entailment is based on a bad parse of the sentence.	0
115	5323	5323	S10-12	Introduction	48	52	4.0	2.0	"Introducing dummy words like ""someone"" or ""something"" alleviates part of the problem but does not help in the case of clausal complements."	0
116	5324	5324	S10-12	Introduction	49	53	4.0	2.0	In summary, PETE makes the annotation phase more practical and consistent but shifts the difficulty to the entailment creation phase.	0
117	5325	5325	S10-12	Introduction	50	54	4.0	2.0	PETE gets closer to an extrinsic evaluation by focusing on semantically relevant, application oriented differences that can be expressed in natural language sentences.	0
118	5326	5326	S10-12	Introduction	51	55	4.0	2.0	This makes the evaluation procedure indirect: a parser developer has to write an extension that can handle entailment questions.	0
119	5327	5327	S10-12	Introduction	52	56	4.0	2.0	However, given the simplicity of the entailments, the complexity of such an extension is comparable to one that extracts grammatical relations.	0
120	5328	5328	S10-12	Introduction	53	57	4.0	2.0	The balance of what is being evaluated is also important.	0
121	5329	5329	S10-12	Introduction	54	58	4.0	2.0	A treebank based evaluation scheme may mix semantically relevant and irrelevant mistakes, but at least it covers every sentence at a uniform level of detail.	0
122	5330	5330	S10-12	Introduction	55	59	4.0	2.0	In this evaluation, we focused on sentences and relations where state of the art parsers disagree.	0

130	5810	5810	S10-18	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Sentiment ambiguous adjectives cause major difficulties for existing algorithms of sentiment analysis.	0
131	5811	5811	S10-18	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	We present an evaluation task designed to provide a framework for comparing different approaches in this problem.	0
132	5812	5812	S10-18	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	We define the task, describe the data creation, list the participating systems and discuss their results.	0
133	5813	5813	S10-18	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	There are 8 teams and 16 systems.	0
134	5814	5814	S10-18	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	In recent years, sentiment analysis has attracted considerable attention (Pang and Lee, 2008).	0
135	5815	5815	S10-18	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	It is the task of mining positive and negative opinions from natural language, which can be applied to many natural language processing tasks, such as document summarization and question answering.	0
136	5816	5816	S10-18	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	Previous work on this problem falls into three groups: opinion mining of documents, sentiment classification of sentences and polarity prediction of words.	0
137	5817	5817	S10-18	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	Sentiment analysis both at document and sentence level rely heavily on word level.	0
138	5818	5818	S10-18	Introduction	5	10	1.0	1.0	The most frequently explored task at word level is to determine the semantic orientation (SO) of words, in which most work centers on assigning a prior polarity to words or word senses in the lexicon out of context.	0
139	5819	5819	S10-18	Introduction	6	11	1.0	1.0	However, for some words, the polarity varies strongly with context, making it hard to attach each to a specific sentiment category in the lexicon.	0
140	5820	5820	S10-18	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	"For example, consider "" low cost"" versus "" low salary"" ."	0
141	5821	5821	S10-18	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	"The word "" low"" has a positive orientation in the first case but a negative orientation in the second case."	0
142	5822	5822	S10-18	Introduction	9	14	2.0	1.0	Turney and Littman (2003) claimed that sentiment ambiguous words could not be avoided easily in a real-world application in the future research.	0
143	5823	5823	S10-18	Introduction	10	15	2.0	1.0	But unfortunately, sentiment ambiguous words are discarded by most research concerning sentiment analysis (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;	0
144	5824	5824	S10-18	Introduction	11	16	2.0	1.0	Turney and Littman, 2003;Kim and Hovy, 2004).	0
145	5825	5825	S10-18	Introduction	12	17	2.0	1.0	The exception work is Ding et al. (2008).	0
146	5826	5826	S10-18	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	They call these words as context dependant opinions and propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solve this problem.	0

152	5832	5832	S10-18	Introduction	19	24	4.0	1.0	Their experimental results suggest that the classification of pairs containing ambiguous adjectives is much harder than those with unambiguous adjectives.	0
153	5833	5833	S10-18	Introduction	20	25	4.0	1.0	The task 18 at SemEval 2010 provides a benchmark data set to encourage studies on this problem.	0

163	6980	6980	S12-6	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of semantic equivalence between two texts.	0
164	6981	6981	S12-6	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	This paper presents the results of the STS pilot task in Semeval.	0
165	6982	6982	S12-6	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The training data contained 2000 sentence pairs from previously existing paraphrase datasets and machine translation evaluation resources.	0
166	6983	6983	S12-6	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	The test data also comprised 2000 sentences pairs for those datasets, plus two surprise datasets with 400 pairs from a different machine translation evaluation corpus and 750 pairs from a lexical resource mapping exercise.	0
167	6984	6984	S12-6	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	The similarity of pairs of sentences was rated on a 0-5 scale (low to high similarity) by human judges using Amazon Mechanical Turk, with high Pearson correlation scores, around 90%.	0
168	6985	6985	S12-6	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	35 teams participated in the task, submitting 88 runs.	0
169	6986	6986	S12-6	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	The best results scored a Pearson correlation &gt;80%, well above a simple lexical baseline that only scored a 31% correlation.	0
170	6987	6987	S12-6	abstract	8	9	4.0	1.0	This pilot task opens an exciting way ahead, although there are still open issues, specially the evaluation metric.	0
171	6988	6988	S12-6	Introduction	1	10	1.0	1.0	Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences.	0
172	6989	6989	S12-6	Introduction	2	11	1.0	1.0	STS is related to both Textual Entailment (TE) and Paraphrase (PARA).	0
173	6990	6990	S12-6	Introduction	3	12	1.0	1.0	STS is more directly applicable in a number of NLP tasks than TE and PARA such as Machine Translation and evaluation, Summarization, Machine Reading, Deep Question Answering, etc. STS differs from TE in as much as it assumes symmetric graded equivalence between the pair of textual snippets.	0
174	6991	6991	S12-6	Introduction	4	13	1.0	1.0	In the case of TE the equivalence is directional, e.g. a car is a vehicle, but a vehicle is not necessarily a car.	0
175	6992	6992	S12-6	Introduction	5	14	2.0	1.0	Additionally, STS differs from both TE and PARA in that, rather than being a binary yes/no decision (e.g. a vehicle is not a car), STS incorporates the notion of graded semantic similarity (e.g. a vehicle and a car are more similar than a wave and a car).	0
176	6993	6993	S12-6	Introduction	6	15	2.0	1.0	STS provides a unified framework that allows for an extrinsic evaluation of multiple semantic components that otherwise have tended to be evaluated independently and without broad characterization of their impact on NLP applications.	0
177	6994	6994	S12-6	Introduction	7	16	2.0	1.0	Such components include word sense disambiguation and induction, lexical substitution, semantic role labeling, multiword expression detection and handling, anaphora and coreference resolution, time and date resolution, named-entity handling, underspecification, hedging, semantic scoping and discourse analysis.	0
178	6995	6995	S12-6	Introduction	8	17	2.0	1.0	Though not in the scope of the current pilot task, we plan to explore building an open source toolkit for integrating and applying diverse linguistic analysis modules to the STS task.	0
179	6996	6996	S12-6	Introduction	9	18	2.0	1.0	While the characterization of STS is still preliminary, we observed that there was no comparable existing dataset extensively annotated for pairwise semantic sentence similarity.	0
180	6997	6997	S12-6	Introduction	10	19	3.0	1.0	We approached the construction of the first STS dataset with the following goals: (1)	0
181	6998	6998	S12-6	Introduction	11	20	3.0	1.0	To set a definition of STS as a graded notion which can be easily communicated to non-expert annotators beyond the likert-scale; (2)	0
182	6999	6999	S12-6	Introduction	12	21	3.0	1.0	To gather a substantial amount of sentence pairs from diverse datasets, and to annotate them with high quality; (3)	0
183	7000	7000	S12-6	Introduction	13	22	3.0	1.0	To explore evaluation measures for STS; (4)	0

195	8124	8124	S13-5	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	Numerous past tasks have focused on leveraging the meaning of word types or words in context.	0
196	8125	8125	S13-5	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	Examples of the former are noun categorization and the TOEFL test, examples of the latter are word sense disambiguation, metonymy resolution, and lexical substitution.	0
197	8126	8126	S13-5	Introduction	3	9	1.0	1.0	As these tasks have enjoyed a lot success, a natural progression is the pursuit of models that can perform similar tasks taking into account multiword expressions and complex compositional structure.	0
198	8127	8127	S13-5	Introduction	4	10	1.0	1.0	In this paper, we present two subtasks designed to evaluate such phrasal models: a. Semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases b.	1
199	8128	8128	S13-5	Introduction	5	11	1.0	1.0	Evaluating the compositionality of phrases in context	1
200	8129	8129	S13-5	Introduction	6	12	2.0	1.0	"For example, the first subtask addresses computing how similar the word ""valuation"" is to the compositional sequence ""price assessment"", while the second subtask addresses deciding whether the phrase ""piece of cake"" is used literally or figuratively in the sentence ""Labour was a piece of cake!""."	0
201	8130	8130	S13-5	Introduction	7	13	2.0	1.0	The aim of these subtasks is two-fold.	0
202	8131	8131	S13-5	Introduction	8	14	2.0	1.0	Firstly, considering that there is a spread interest lately in phrasal semantics in its various guises, they provide an opportunity to draw together approaches to numerous related problems under a common evaluation set.	0
203	8132	8132	S13-5	Introduction	9	15	2.0	1.0	It is intended that after the competition, the evaluation setting and the datasets will comprise an on-going benchmark for the evaluation of these phrasal models.	0
204	8133	8133	S13-5	Introduction	10	16	2.0	1.0	Secondly, the subtasks attempt to bridge the gap between established lexical semantics and fullblown linguistic inference.	0
205	8134	8134	S13-5	Introduction	11	17	2.0	1.0	Thus, we anticipate that they will stimulate an increased interest around the general issue of phrasal semantics.	0
206	8135	8135	S13-5	Introduction	12	18	3.0	1.0	We use the notion of phrasal semantics here as opposed to lexical compounds or compositional semantics.	0
207	8136	8136	S13-5	Introduction	13	19	3.0	1.0	Bridging the gap between lexical semantics and linguistic inference could provoke novel approaches to certain established tasks, such as lexical entailment and paraphrase identification.	0
208	8137	8137	S13-5	Introduction	14	20	3.0	1.0	In addition, it could ul-timately lead to improvements in a wide range of applications in natural language processing, such as document retrieval, clustering and classification, question answering, query expansion, synonym extraction, relation extraction, automatic translation, or textual advertisement matching in search engines, all of which depend on phrasal semantics.	0
209	8138	8138	S13-5	Introduction	15	21	3.0	1.0	The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents details about the data sources and the variety of sources applicable to the task.	0
210	8139	8139	S13-5	Introduction	16	22	3.0	1.0	Section 3 discusses the first subtask, which is about semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases.	0

219	9050	9050	S13-11	abstract	1	2	2.0	1.0	In this paper we describe our Semeval-2013 task on Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation within an end-user application, namely Web search result clustering and diversification.	0
220	9051	9051	S13-11	abstract	2	3	3.0	1.0	Given a target query, induction and disambiguation systems are requested to cluster and diversify the search results returned by a search engine for that query.	1
221	9052	9052	S13-11	abstract	3	4	4.0	1.0	The task enables the end-to-end evaluation and comparison of systems.	0
222	9053	9053	S13-11	Introduction	1	5	1.0	1.0	Word ambiguity is a pervasive issue in Natural Language Processing.	0
223	9054	9054	S13-11	Introduction	2	6	1.0	1.0	Two main techniques in computational lexical semantics, i.e., Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Word Sense Induction (WSI) address this issue from different perspectives: the former is aimed at assigning word senses from a predefined sense inventory to words in context, whereas the latter automatically identifies the meanings of a word of interest by clustering the contexts in which it occurs (see (Navigli, 2009;	0
224	9055	9055	S13-11	Introduction	3	7	1.0	1.0	Navigli, 2012) for a survey).	0
225	9056	9056	S13-11	Introduction	4	8	1.0	1.0	Unfortunately, the paradigms of both WSD and WSI suffer from significant issues which hamper their success in real-world applications.	0
226	9057	9057	S13-11	Introduction	5	9	1.0	1.0	In fact, the performance of WSD systems depends heavily on which sense inventory is chosen.	0
227	9058	9058	S13-11	Introduction	6	10	2.0	1.0	For instance, the most popular computational lexicon of English, i.e., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides fine-grained distinctions which make the disambiguation task quite difficult even for humans (Edmonds and Kilgarriff, 2002;	0
228	9059	9059	S13-11	Introduction	7	11	2.0	1.0	Snyder and Palmer, 2004), although disagreements can be solved to some extent with graph-based methods (Navigli, 2008).	0
229	9060	9060	S13-11	Introduction	8	12	2.0	1.0	On the other hand, although WSI overcomes this issue by allowing unrestrained sets of senses, its evaluation is particularly arduous because there is no easy way of comparing and ranking different representations of senses.	0
230	9061	9061	S13-11	Introduction	9	13	2.0	1.0	In fact, all the proposed measures in the literature tend to favour specific cluster shapes (e.g., singletons or all-in-one clusters) of the senses produced as output.	0
231	9062	9062	S13-11	Introduction	10	14	2.0	1.0	Indeed, WSI evaluation is actually an instance of the more general and difficult problem of evaluating clustering algorithms.	0
232	9063	9063	S13-11	Introduction	11	15	3.0	1.0	Nonetheless, many everyday tasks carried out by online users would benefit from intelligent systems able to address the lexical ambiguity issue effectively.	0
233	9064	9064	S13-11	Introduction	12	16	3.0	1.0	A case in point is Web information retrieval, a task which is becoming increasingly difficult given the continuously growing pool of Web text of the most wildly disparate kinds.	0
234	9065	9065	S13-11	Introduction	13	17	3.0	1.0	Recent work has addressed this issue by proposing a general evaluation framework for injecting WSI into Web search result clustering and diversification (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010;	0
235	9066	9066	S13-11	Introduction	14	18	3.0	1.0	Di Marco and Navigli, 2013).	0
236	9067	9067	S13-11	Introduction	15	19	3.0	1.0	In this task the search results returned by a search engine for an input query are grouped into clusters, and diversified by providing a reranking which maximizes the meaning heterogeneity of the top ranking results.	0
237	9068	9068	S13-11	Introduction	16	20	4.0	1.0	The Semeval-2013 task described in this paper 1 adopts the evaluation framework of Di Marco and Navigli (2013), and extends it to both WSD and WSI systems.	0
238	9069	9069	S13-11	Introduction	17	21	4.0	1.0	The task is aimed at overcoming the wellknown limitations of in vitro evaluations, such as those of previous SemEval tasks on the topic (Agirre and Soroa, 2007;Manandhar et al., 2010), and enabling a fair comparison between the two disambiguation paradigms.	0
239	9070	9070	S13-11	Introduction	18	22	4.0	1.0	Key to our framework is the assumption that search results grouped into a given cluster are semantically related to each other and that each cluster is expected to represent a specific meaning of the input query (even though it is possible for more than one cluster to represent the same meaning).	0
240	9071	9071	S13-11	Introduction	19	23	4.0	1.0	For instance, consider the target query apple and the following 3 search result snippets:	0

248	9375	9375	S13-13	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	A long-standing task, WSD is fundamental to many NLP applications (Navigli, 2009).	0
249	9376	9376	S13-13	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	Typically, each usage of a word is treated as expressing only a single sense.	0
250	9377	9377	S13-13	Introduction	4	9	1.0	1.0	However, contextual ambiguity as well as the relatedness of certain meanings can potentially elicit multiple sense interpretations.	0
251	9378	9378	S13-13	Introduction	5	10	2.0	1.0	Recent work has shown that annotators find multiple applicable senses in a given target word context when using fine-grained sense inventories such as WordNet (Véronis, 1998;Murray and Green, 2004;	0
252	9379	9379	S13-13	Introduction	6	11	2.0	1.0	Passonneau et al., 2012b;Jurgens, 2013;Navigli et al., 2013).	0
253	9380	9380	S13-13	Introduction	7	12	2.0	1.0	Such contexts would be better annotated with multiple sense labels, weighting each sense according to its applicability Jurgens, 2013), in effect allowing ambiguity or multiple interpretations to be explicitly modeled.	0
254	9381	9381	S13-13	Introduction	8	13	2.0	1.0	Accordingly, the first goal of this task is to evaluate WSD systems in a setting where instances may be labeled with one or more senses, weighted by their applicability.	0
255	9382	9382	S13-13	Introduction	9	14	3.0	1.0	WSD methods are ultimately defined and potentially restricted by their choice in sense inventory; for example, a sense inventory may have insufficient sense-annotated data to build WSD systems for specific types of text (e.g., social media), or the inventory may lack domain-specific senses.	0
256	9383	9383	S13-13	Introduction	10	15	3.0	1.0	Word Sense Induction (WSI) has been proposed as a method for overcoming such limitations by learning the senses automatically from text.	0
257	9384	9384	S13-13	Introduction	11	16	3.0	1.0	In essence, a WSI algorithm acts as a lexicographer by grouping word usages according to their shared meaning.	0
258	9385	9385	S13-13	Introduction	12	17	3.0	1.0	The second goal of this task is to assess the performance of WSI algorithms when they are able to model multiple meanings of a usage with graded senses.	0
259	9386	9386	S13-13	Introduction	13	18	4.0	1.0	Task 12 focuses on disambiguating senses for 50 target lemmas: 20 nouns, 20 verbs, and 10 adjectives (Sec. 2).	0
260	9387	9387	S13-13	Introduction	14	19	4.0	1.0	Since the Task evaluates only unsupervised systems, no training data was provided; however, to enable more comparison, Unsupervised WSD systems were also allowed to participate.	0
261	9388	9388	S13-13	Introduction	15	20	4.0	1.0	Participating systems were evaluated in two settings (Sec. 3), depending on whether they used induced senses or WordNet 3.1 senses for their annotations.	0
262	9389	9389	S13-13	Introduction	16	21	4.0	1.0	The results (Sec. 5) demonstrate a substantial improvement over the competitive most frequent sense baseline.	0
263	9390	9390	S13-13	Task Description	1	22	1.0	1.0	This task required participating systems to annotate instances of nouns, verb, and adjectives using Word-Net 3.1 (Fellbaum, 1998), which was selected due to its fine-grained senses.	1
264	9391	9391	S13-13	Task Description	2	23	1.0	1.0	Participants could label each instance with one or more senses, weighting	1

274	9553	9553	S13-13	Conclusion	1	185	1.0	4.0	We have introduced a new evaluation setting for WSI and WSD systems where systems are measured by their ability to detect and weight multiple applicable senses for a single context.	0
275	9554	9554	S13-13	Conclusion	2	186	2.0	4.0	Four teams submitted nine systems, annotating a total of 4664 contexts for 50 words from the OANC.	0
276	9555	9555	S13-13	Conclusion	3	187	2.0	4.0	Many systems were able to surpass the competitive MFS baseline.	0
277	9556	9556	S13-13	Conclusion	4	188	3.0	4.0	Furthermore, when WSI systems were trained to produce only a single sense label, the performance of resulting semi-supervised WSD systems surpassed that of many supervised systems in previous WSD evaluations.	0

283	10488	10488	S14-6	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	Task 6 aims to advance semantic parsing research by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to compare and evaluate approaches.	0
284	10489	10489	S14-6	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The task focuses on contextual parsing of robotic commands, in which the additional context of spatial scenes can be used to guide a parser to control a robot arm.	1
285	10490	10490	S14-6	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	Six teams submitted systems using both rule-based and statistical methods.	0
286	10491	10491	S14-6	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	The best performing (hybrid) system scored 92.5% and 90.5% for parsing with and without spatial context.	0
287	10492	10492	S14-6	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	However, the best performing statistical system scored 87.35% and 60.84% respectively, indicating that generalized understanding of commands given to a robot remains challenging, despite the fixed domain used for the task.	0
288	10493	10493	S14-6	Introduction	1	8	1.0	1.0	Semantic parsers analyze sentences to produce formal meaning representations that are used for the computational understanding of natural language.	0
289	10494	10494	S14-6	Introduction	2	9	1.0	1.0	Recently, state-of-the-art semantic parsing methods have used for a variety of applications, including question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013;	0
290	10495	10495	S14-6	Introduction	3	10	1.0	1.0	Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012), dialog systems (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011), entity relation extraction (Kate and Mooney, 2010) and robotic control (Tellex, 2011;	0
291	10496	10496	S14-6	Introduction	4	11	1.0	1.0	Kim and Mooney, 2012).	0
292	10497	10497	S14-6	Introduction	5	12	1.0	1.0	Different parsers can be distinguished by the level of supervision they require during training.	0
293	10498	10498	S14-6	Introduction	6	13	2.0	1.0	Fully supervised training typically requires an annotated dataset that maps natural language (NL) to a formal meaning representation such as logical form.	0
294	10499	10499	S14-6	Introduction	7	14	2.0	1.0	However, because annotated data is often not available, a recent trend in semantic parsing research has been to eschew supervised training in favour of either unsupervised or weakly-supervised methods that utilize additional information.	0
295	10500	10500	S14-6	Introduction	8	15	2.0	1.0	For example, Berant and Liang (2014) use a dataset of 5,810 questionanswer pairs without annotated logical forms to induce a parser for a question-answering system.	0
296	10501	10501	S14-6	Introduction	9	16	2.0	1.0	In comparison, Poon (2013) converts NL questions into formal queries via indirect supervision through database interaction.	0
297	10502	10502	S14-6	Introduction	10	17	2.0	1.0	In contrast to previous work, the shared task described in this paper uses the Robot Commands Treebank (Dukes, 2013a), a new dataset made available for supervised semantic parsing.	0
298	10503	10503	S14-6	Introduction	11	18	2.0	1.0	The chosen domain is robotic control, in which NL commands are given to a robot arm used to manipulate shapes on an 8 x 8 game board.	0
299	10504	10504	S14-6	Introduction	12	19	3.0	1.0	Despite the fixed domain, the task is challenging as correctly parsing commands requires understanding spatial context.	0
300	10505	10505	S14-6	Introduction	13	20	3.0	1.0	For example, the command in Figure 1 may have several plausible interpretations, given different board configurations.	0

303	10508	10508	S14-6	Introduction	16	23	3.0	1.0	The task is inspired by the classic AI system SHRLDU, which responded to NL commands to control a robot for a similar game board (Winograd, 1972), although that system is reported to not have generalized well (Dreyfus, 2009;	0
304	10509	10509	S14-6	Introduction	17	24	3.0	1.0	Mitkov, 1999).	0
305	10510	10510	S14-6	Introduction	18	25	4.0	1.0	More recent research in command understanding has focused on parsing jointly with grounding, the process of mapping NL descriptions of entities within an environment to a semantic representation.	0
306	10511	10511	S14-6	Introduction	19	26	4.0	1.0	Previous work includes Tellex et al. (2011), who develop a small corpus of commands for a simulated fork lift robot, with grounding performed using a factor graph.	0
307	10512	10512	S14-6	Introduction	20	27	4.0	1.0	Similarly, Kim and Mooney (2012) perform joint parsing and grounding using a corpus of navigation commands.	0
308	10513	10513	S14-6	Introduction	21	28	4.0	1.0	In contrast, this paper focuses on parsing using additional situational context for disambiguation and by using a larger NL dataset, in comparison to previous robotics research.	0
309	10514	10514	S14-6	Introduction	22	29	4.0	1.0	In the remainder of this paper, we describe the task, the dataset and the metrics used for evaluation.	0
310	10515	10515	S14-6	Introduction	23	30	4.0	1.0	We then compare the approaches used by participant systems and conclude with suggested improvements for future work.	0
311	10516	10516	S14-6	Task Description	1	31	1.0	1.0	The long term research goal encouraged by the task is to develop a system that will robustly execute NL robotic commands.	0
312	10517	10517	S14-6	Task Description	2	32	2.0	1.0	In general, this is a highly complex problem involving computational processing of language, spatial reasoning, contextual awareness and knowledge representation.	0
313	10518	10518	S14-6	Task Description	3	33	2.0	1.0	To simplify the problem, participants were provided with additional tools and resources, allowing them to focus on developing a semantic parser for a fixed domain that would fit into an existing component architecture.	0
314	10519	10519	S14-6	Task Description	4	34	3.0	1.0	Figure 2 shows how these components interact.	0
315	10520	10520	S14-6	Task Description	5	35	4.0	1.0	Semantic parser: Systems submitted by participants are semantic parsers that accept an NL command as input, mapping this to a formal Robot Control Language (RCL), described further in section 3.3.	0
316	10521	10521	S14-6	Task Description	6	36	4.0	1.0	The Robot Commands Treebank used for the both training and evaluation is an annotated corpus that pairs NL commands with contextual RCL statements.	0
317	10671	10671	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	1	186	1.0	4.0	This paper described a new task for SemEval: Supervised Semantic Parsing of Robotic Spatial Commands.	0
318	10672	10672	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	2	187	1.0	4.0	Despite its novel nature, the task attracted high-quality submissions from six teams, using a variety of semantic parsing strategies.	0
319	10673	10673	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	3	188	1.0	4.0	It is hoped that this task will reappear at Se-mEval.	0
320	10674	10674	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	4	189	2.0	4.0	Several lessons were learnt from this first version of the shared task which can be used to improve the task in future.	0
321	10675	10675	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	5	190	2.0	4.0	One issue which several participants noted was the way in which the treebank was split into training and evaluation datasets.	0
322	10676	10676	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	6	191	2.0	4.0	Out of the 3,409 sentences in the treebank, the first 2,500 sequential sentences were chosen for training.	0
323	10677	10677	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	7	192	3.0	4.0	Because this data was not randomized, certain syntactic structures were only found during evaluation and were not present in the training data.	0
324	10678	10678	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	8	193	3.0	4.0	Although this may have affected results, all participants evaluated their systems against the same datasets.	0
325	10679	10679	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	9	194	3.0	4.0	Based on participant feedback, in addition to reporting P and NP-measures, it would also be illuminating to include a metric such as Parseval F1-scores to measure partial accuracy.	0
326	10680	10680	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	10	195	4.0	4.0	An improved version of the task could also feature a better dataset by expanding the treebank, not only in terms of size but also in terms of linguistic structure.	0
327	10681	10681	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	11	196	4.0	4.0	Many commands captured in the annotation game are not yet represented in RCL due to linguistic phenomena such as negation and conditional statements.	0
328	10682	10682	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	12	197	4.0	4.0	Looking forward, a more promising approach to improving the spatial planner could be probabilistic planning, so that semantic parsers could interface with probabilistic facts with confidence measures.	0
329	10683	10683	S14-6	Conclusion and Future Work	13	198	4.0	4.0	This approach is particularly suitable for robotics, where sensors often supply noisy signals about the robot's environment.	0

333	11013	11013	S14-9	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	As in 2013, this was the most popular SemEval task; a total of 46 teams contributed 27 submissions for subtask A (21 teams) and 50 submissions for subtask B (44 teams).	0
334	11014	11014	S14-9	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	This year, we introduced three new test sets: (i) regular tweets, (ii) sarcastic tweets, and (iii) LiveJournal sentences.	0
335	11015	11015	S14-9	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	We further tested on (iv) 2013 tweets, and (v) 2013 SMS messages.	0
336	11016	11016	S14-9	abstract	6	7	4.0	1.0	The highest F1score on (i) was achieved by NRC-Canada at 86.63 for subtask A and by TeamX at 70.96 for subtask B.	0

350	11030	11030	S14-9	Introduction	14	21	3.0	1.0	Several corpora with detailed opinion and sentiment annotation have been made freely available, e.g., the MPQA newswire corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005), the movie reviews corpus (Pang et al., 2002), or the restaurant and laptop reviews corpora that are part of this year's SemEval Task 4 (Pontiki et al., 2014).	0
351	11031	11031	S14-9	Introduction	15	22	3.0	1.0	These corpora have proved very valuable as resources for learning about the language of sentiment in general, but they do not focus on tweets.	0
352	11032	11032	S14-9	Introduction	16	23	3.0	1.0	While some Twitter sentiment datasets were created prior to SemEval-2013, they were either small and proprietary, such as the isieve corpus (Kouloumpis et al., 2011) or focused solely on message-level sentiment.	0
353	11033	11033	S14-9	Introduction	17	24	3.0	1.0	Thus, the primary goal of our SemEval task is to promote research that will lead to better understanding of how sentiment is conveyed in Social Media.	0
354	11034	11034	S14-9	Introduction	18	25	3.0	1.0	Toward that goal, we created the Se-mEval Tweet corpus as part of our inaugural Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Task, SemEval-2013 Task 2 (Nakov et al., 2013).	0
355	11035	11035	S14-9	Introduction	19	26	3.0	1.0	It contains tweets and SMS messages with sentiment expressions annotated with contextual phrase-level and messagelevel polarity.	0
356	11036	11036	S14-9	Introduction	20	27	4.0	1.0	This year, we extended the corpus by adding new tweets and LiveJournal sentences.	0
357	11037	11037	S14-9	Introduction	21	28	4.0	1.0	Another interesting phenomenon that has been studied in Twitter is the use of the #sarcasm hashtag to indicate that a tweet should not be taken literally (González-Ibáñez et al., 2011;	0
358	11038	11038	S14-9	Introduction	22	29	4.0	1.0	Liebrecht et al., 2013).	0
359	11039	11039	S14-9	Introduction	23	30	4.0	1.0	In fact, sarcasm indicates that the message polarity should be flipped.	0

373	11144	11144	S14-9	Conclusion	3	135	2.0	4.0	We introduced three new test sets for 2014: an in-domain Twitter dataset, an out-of-domain Live-Journal test set, and a dataset of tweets containing sarcastic content.	0
374	11145	11145	S14-9	Conclusion	4	136	2.0	4.0	While the performance on the LiveJournal test set was mostly comparable to the in-domain Twitter test set, for most teams there was a sharp drop in performance for sarcastic tweets, highlighting better handling of sarcastic language as one important direction for future work in Twitter sentiment analysis.	0

402	13717	13717	S15-13	title	1	1	4.0	1.0	SemEval-2015 Task 13: Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking	1
403	13718	13718	S15-13	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	In this paper we present the Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking task.	1
404	13719	13719	S15-13	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL) are well-known problems in the Natural Language Processing field and both address the lexical ambiguity of language.	0
405	13720	13720	S15-13	abstract	3	4	3.0	1.0	Their main difference lies in the kind of meaning inventories that are used: EL uses encyclopedic knowledge, while WSD uses lexicographic information.	0
406	13721	13721	S15-13	abstract	4	5	4.0	1.0	Our aim with this task is to analyze whether, and if so, how, using a resource that integrates both kinds of inventories (i.e., BabelNet 2.5.1) might enable WSD and EL to be solved by means of similar (even, the same) methods.	0
407	13722	13722	S15-13	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	Moreover, we investigate this task in a multilingual setting and for some specific domains.	0
408	13723	13723	S15-13	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	The Senseval and SemEval evaluation series represent key moments in the community of computational linguistics and related areas.	0
409	13724	13724	S15-13	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	Their focus has been to provide objective evaluations of methods within the wide spectrum of semantic techniques for tasks mainly related to automatic text understanding.	0
410	13725	13725	S15-13	Introduction	3	9	1.0	1.0	Through SemEval-2015 task 13 we both continue and renew the longstanding tradition of disambiguation tasks, by addressing multilingual WSD and EL in a joint manner.	0
411	13726	13726	S15-13	Introduction	4	10	1.0	1.0	WSD (Navigli, 2009;	0
412	13727	13727	S15-13	Introduction	5	11	1.0	1.0	Navigli, 2012) is a historical task aimed at explicitly assigning meanings to single-word and multi-word occurrences within text, a task which today is more alive than ever in the research community.	0

415	13730	13730	S15-13	Introduction	8	14	2.0	1.0	Rao et al., 2013) is a more recent task which aims at discovering mentions of entities within a text and linking them to the most suitable entry in a knowledge base.	0
416	13731	13731	S15-13	Introduction	9	15	2.0	1.0	Both these tasks aim at handling the inherent ambiguity of natural language, however WSD tackles it from a lexicographic perspective, while EL tackles it from an encyclopedic one.	0
417	13732	13732	S15-13	Introduction	10	16	2.0	1.0	Specifically, the main difference between the two tasks lies in the kind of inventory they use.	0
418	13733	13733	S15-13	Introduction	11	17	2.0	1.0	For instance, WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), a manually curated semantic network for the English language, has become the main reference inventory for English WSD systems thanks to its wide coverage of verbs, adverbs, adjectives and common nouns.	0
419	13734	13734	S15-13	Introduction	12	18	3.0	1.0	More recently, Wikipedia has been shown to be an optimal resource for recovering named entities, and has consequently become -together with all its semi-automatic derivations such as DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) -the main reference inventory for EL systems.	0
420	13735	13735	S15-13	Introduction	13	19	3.0	1.0	Over the years, the research community has typically focused on each of these tasks separately.	0
421	13736	13736	S15-13	Introduction	14	20	3.0	1.0	Recently, however, joint approaches have been proposed (Moro et al., 2014b).	0
422	13737	13737	S15-13	Introduction	15	21	3.0	1.0	One of the reasons for pursuing the unification of these tasks derives from the current trend in knowledge acquisition which consists of the seamless integration of encyclopedic and lexicographic knowledge within structured language resources (Hovy et al., 2013).	0
423	13738	13738	S15-13	Introduction	16	22	3.0	1.0	A case in point here is BabelNet 1 , a multilingual semantic network and encyclopedic dictionary (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012).	0
424	13739	13739	S15-13	Introduction	17	23	4.0	1.0	Resources like BabelNet provide a common ground for the tasks of WSD and EL.	0
425	13740	13740	S15-13	Introduction	18	24	4.0	1.0	In this task our goal is to promote research in the direction of joint word sense and named entity disambiguation, so as to concentrate research efforts on the aspects that differentiate these two tasks without duplicating research on common problems such as identifying the right meaning in context.	0
426	13741	13741	S15-13	Introduction	19	25	4.0	1.0	However, we are also interested in systems that perform only one of the two tasks, and even systems which tackle one particular setting of WSD, such as allwords sense disambiguation vs. any subset of partof-speech tags.	0
427	13742	13742	S15-13	Introduction	20	26	4.0	1.0	Moreover, given the recent upsurge of interest in multilingual approaches, we developed the task dataset in three different languages (English, Italian and Spanish) on parallel texts which have been independently and manually annotated by different native/fluent speakers.	0
428	13743	13743	S15-13	Introduction	21	27	4.0	1.0	In contrast to the SemEval-2013 task 12 on Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation , our focus in task 13 is to present a dataset containing both kinds of inventories (i.e., named entities and word senses) in different specific domains (biomedical domain, maths and computer domain, and a broader domain about social issues).	0
429	13744	13744	S15-13	Introduction	22	28	4.0	1.0	Our goal is to further investigate the distance between research efforts regarding the dichotomy EL vs. WSD and those regarding the dichotomy open domain vs. closed domain.	0
430	13745	13745	S15-13	Task Setup	1	29	1.0	1.0	The task setup consists of annotating four tokenized and part-of-speech tagged documents for which parallel versions in three languages (English, Italian and Spanish) have been provided.	0

439	23181	23181	S19-2	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	Results are useful in identifying polysemous words, i.e., those whose frame structures are not easily distinguished, as well as discerning semantic relations of the arguments.	0
440	23182	23182	S19-2	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	Evaluation of unsupervised frame induction methods fell into two tracks: Task A) Verb Clustering based on FrameNet 1.7; and B) Argument Clustering, with B.1) based on FrameNet's core frame elements, and B.2) on VerbNet 3.2 semantic roles.	0

444	23186	23186	S19-2	Introduction	2	10	1.0	1.0	Task 2 focused on the unsupervised semantic labeling of a set of prespecified (semantically) unlabeled structures (Figure 1).	0
445	23187	23187	S19-2	Introduction	3	11	1.0	1.0	Unsupervised learning methods analyze these structures (Figure 1a) to augment them with semantic labels (Figure 1b).	0
446	23188	23188	S19-2	Introduction	4	12	1.0	1.0	The shape of the manually labeled input frames is constrained to an acyclic connected tree of lexical items (words and multi-word units) of maximum depth 1, where just one root governs several arguments.	0
447	23189	23189	S19-2	Introduction	5	13	2.0	1.0	The task used Berkeley FrameNet (FN) (Ruppenhofer et al., 2016) and Q. Zadeh and Petruck (2019), guidelines for this task, to determine the arguments and label them with semantic information.	0
448	23190	23190	S19-2	Introduction	6	14	2.0	1.0	We compared the proposed system results for unsupervised semantic tagging with that of human annotated (or, gold-standard) data in three different subtasks (Figure 2).	0
449	23191	23191	S19-2	Introduction	7	15	2.0	1.0	To evaluate the systems, we computed distributional similarities between  their generated unsupervised labeled data and human annotated reference data.	0
450	23192	23192	S19-2	Introduction	8	16	2.0	1.0	For computing similarities we used general purpose numeral methods of text clustering, in particular BCUBED F-SCORE (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) as the single figure of merit to rank the systems.	0
451	23193	23193	S19-2	Introduction	9	17	3.0	1.0	The most important result of the shared task is the creation of a benchmark for a future complex task.	0
452	23194	23194	S19-2	Introduction	10	18	3.0	1.0	This benchmark includes a moderately sized, manually annotated set of frames, where only the verbs of each were included, along with their core frame elements (which uniquely define a frame as Ruppenhofer et al. describe).	0
453	23195	23195	S19-2	Introduction	11	19	3.0	1.0	To complement FN's core frame elements that have highly specific meanings, the benchmark also includes the annotated argument structures of the verbs based on the generic semantic roles proposed for verb classes in VerbNet 3.2 (Kipper et al., 2000;	0

458	23200	23200	S19-2	Introduction	16	24	4.0	1.0	The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contextualizes this task; Section 3 offers a detailed task-description; Section 4 describes the data; Section 5 introduces the evaluation metrics and baselines; Section 6 characterizes the participating systems and unsupervised methods that participants used; Section 7 provides evaluation scores and additional insight about the data; and Section 8 presents concluding remarks.	0
459	23201	23201	S19-2	Background	1	25	1.0	1.0	Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976) and other theories (Gamerschlag et al., 2014) that adopt typed feature structures for representing knowledge and linguistic structures have developed in parallel over several decades in theoretical linguistic studies about the syntax-semantics interface, as well as in empirical corpus-driven applications in natural language processing.	0
460	23202	23202	S19-2	Background	2	26	1.0	1.0	Building repositories of (lexical) semantic frames is a core component in all of these efforts.	0
461	23203	23203	S19-2	Background	3	27	1.0	1.0	In formal studies, lexical semantic frame knowledge bases instantiate foundational theories with tangible examples, e.g., to provide supporting evidence for the theory.	0
462	23204	23204	S19-2	Background	4	28	1.0	1.0	Practically, frame semantic repositories play a pivotal role in natural language understanding and semantic parsing, both as inspiration for a representation format and for training data-driven machine learning systems, which is required for tasks such as information extraction, question-answering, text summarization, among others.	0
463	23205	23205	S19-2	Background	5	29	2.0	1.0	However, manually developing frame semantic databases and annotating corpus-derived illustrative examples to support analyses of frames are resource-intensive tasks.	0
464	23206	23206	S19-2	Background	6	30	2.0	1.0	The most well-known frame semantic (lexical) resource is FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2016), which only covers a (relatively) small set of the vocabulary of contemporary English.	0
465	23207	23207	S19-2	Background	7	31	2.0	1.0	While NLP research has integrated FrameNet data into semantic parsing, e.g., Swayamdipta et al. (2018), these methods cannot extend beyond previously seen training labels, tagging out-of-domain semantics as unknown at best.	0
466	23208	23208	S19-2	Background	8	32	2.0	1.0	This limitation does not hinder unsupervised methods, which will port and extend the coverage of semantic parsers, a common challenge in semantic parsing (Hartmann et al., 2017).	0
467	23209	23209	S19-2	Background	9	33	2.0	1.0	Unsupervised frame induction methods can serve as an assistive semantic analytic tool, to build language resources and facilitate linguistic studies.	0
468	23210	23210	S19-2	Background	10	34	3.0	1.0	Since the focus is usually to build language resources, most systems (Pennacchiotti et al. (2008); Green et al. (2004)) have used a lexical semantic resource like WordNet (Miller, 1995) to extend coverage of a resource like FrameNet.	0

599	26271	26271	S20-4	Related Work	55	268	4.0	4.0	Before organizing this shared-task, a pilot study (Wang et al., 2019) has been performed, showing that there is still a significant gap between human and machine performance when no training data is provided, despite that the models have already been pretrained with over 100 million natural language sentences.	0

602	26274	26274	S20-4	Summary	2	271	1.0	4.0	In this task, we construct a dataset that consists of 11,997 instances and 83,986 sentences.	0
603	26275	26275	S20-4	Summary	3	272	1.0	4.0	The task attracted around 40 participating teams, out of which 31 teams submit their system papers.	0
604	26276	26276	S20-4	Summary	4	273	1.0	4.0	The pretrained models are shown to be very effective in Subtask A and Subtask B, but there is still a large room to improve system performances in Subtask C. Contextualized embedding such as RoBERTa and BART play a central role in the success of the top-performing models, demonstrating that such methods contain commonsense information to a good extent.	0
605	26277	26277	S20-4	Summary	5	274	2.0	4.0	We attribute the high performance on Subtask A and B to several main reasons: 1) Subtask A is a relatively easy question by definition: a model needs only to detect a relatively less plausible content among the two candidate sentences.	0
606	26278	26278	S20-4	Summary	6	275	2.0	4.0	2) Pretrained models are obtained on billion-words large corpora such as Wikipedia data, which help obtain commonsense knowledge (Zhou et al., 2019), which helps achieve considerably better performance.	0
607	26279	26279	S20-4	Summary	7	276	2.0	4.0	3) As described in the annotation process, we use the sentences from OMCS to inspire crowd-sourcing workers.	0
608	26280	26280	S20-4	Summary	8	277	2.0	4.0	The top-3 systems also use OMCS, which potentially help them to attain better performances.	0
609	26281	26281	S20-4	Summary	9	278	2.0	4.0	4) For Subtask B, as discussed in our data analysis section, the data has some flaws in the average length and common words, which reduces the difficulty.	0
610	26282	26282	S20-4	Summary	10	279	3.0	4.0	5) Some instances have obvious patterns.	0
611	26283	26283	S20-4	Summary	11	280	3.0	4.0	"For example, there are tens of instances that contain ""put XXX into YYY"", and ""XXX is bigger than YYY"", making the problems simpler."	0
612	26284	26284	S20-4	Summary	12	281	3.0	4.0	6) Hundreds of crowd-sourcing workers write instances.	0
613	26285	26285	S20-4	Summary	13	282	3.0	4.0	"It is likely for workers to think about the shared commonsense knowledge, such as ""XXX is bigger/shorter/quicker/slower than YYY""."	0
614	26286	26286	S20-4	Summary	14	283	4.0	4.0	We consider future works in four directions: 1) We observe that there is still a gap between machine performance and human performance in Subtask C, and the reason generation task still needs further investigation.	0
615	26287	26287	S20-4	Summary	15	284	4.0	4.0	2) The artifacts or spurious correlations in the datasets can be further removed, e.g., by making different candidate sentences in subtask B be the same, removing instances with shared commonsense knowledge, removing artifacts in common words, and filtering out common patterns.	0
616	26288	26288	S20-4	Summary	16	285	4.0	4.0	3) Subtask A can be turned into a more difficult form.	0
617	26289	26289	S20-4	Summary	17	286	4.0	4.0	Instead of comparing which statement makes more sense, we can form it into a classification task, validating if one statement makes sense or not.	0
618	26290	26290	S20-4	Summary	18	287	4.0	4.0	4) We notice that the BLEU score does not closely align with human evaluation for systems with high performances, and it is desirable to develop an auto-metric for comparing the semantic correlation between two reasons.	0

647	26319	26319	S20-5	Introduction	20	29	3.0	1.0	To build the dataset for counterfactual recognition, we extract over 60,000 candidate counterfactual statements by scanning through news reports in three domains: finance, politics, and healthcare.	0
648	26320	26320	S20-5	Introduction	21	30	3.0	1.0	The first round of annotation focuses on labeling each sample as true or false, where true denotes a sample is counterfactual and false otherwise in Subtask-1.	0

667	26483	26483	S20-5	Related Work	1	193	1.0	4.0	Modelling counterfactual thinking has started to attract more interest.	0
668	26484	26484	S20-5	Related Work	2	194	1.0	4.0	One of the previous works closest to ours is (Son et al., 2017), in which a small-scale counterfactual tweet dataset is collected from social media.	0
669	26485	26485	S20-5	Related Work	3	195	1.0	4.0	There are three main differences between that dataset and ours.	0
670	26486	26486	S20-5	Related Work	4	196	1.0	4.0	First, there are only 2,000 samples in the tweet dataset (including the supplement data mentioned in the paper), while our dataset for counterfactual detection in Subtask-1 is ten times larger, which we believe is important for training deep learning based models.	0
671	26487	26487	S20-5	Related Work	5	197	2.0	4.0	Second, our benchmark provides evaluation for antecedents and consequents extraction, which are essential components of counterfactual analysis.	0
672	26488	26488	S20-5	Related Work	6	198	2.0	4.0	Third, our dataset includes statements from three different domains (finance, politics, healthcare).	0
673	26489	26489	S20-5	Related Work	7	199	2.0	4.0	In contrast to the statements collected from tweets, which have a very large portion that are open-ended, vague thoughts, the counterfactuals in our dataset are more meaningful domain-related statements.	0
674	26490	26490	S20-5	Related Work	8	200	2.0	4.0	There is another dataset TIMETRAVEL proposed in (Qin et al., 2019)  in which given a short story and an alternative counterfactual event context, the story needs to be minimally revised to keep compatible with the intervening counterfactual event.	0
675	26491	26491	S20-5	Related Work	9	201	3.0	4.0	The empirical results show that it is still challenging for current neural language models to perform well on the counterfactual story rewriting task due to the lack of counterfactual reasoning capabilities.	0
676	26492	26492	S20-5	Related Work	10	202	3.0	4.0	In a broader viewpoint, counterfatuals are an important form of causal reasoning.	0
677	26493	26493	S20-5	Related Work	11	203	3.0	4.0	Researchers argue that the notion of counterfactuals is essential for causal reasoning, in which causal modeling is proposed to interpret counterfactual conditionals in natural language, and such work has been discussed since the possible worlds semantics developed in the 1970s (Lewis, 2013;	0
678	26494	26494	S20-5	Related Work	12	204	3.0	4.0	Lewis, 1986).	0
679	26495	26495	S20-5	Related Work	13	205	4.0	4.0	The more recent work renders useful insights by formulating causal inference as a three-level hierarchy, which are association, intervention, and counterfactual, respectively (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018;Pearl, 2019).	0

689	27908	27908	S20-12	Introduction	1	7	1.0	1.0	Offensive language is ubiquitous in social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, and it comes in many forms.	0
690	27909	27909	S20-12	Introduction	2	8	1.0	1.0	Given the multitude of terms and definitions related to offensive language used in the literature, several recent studies have investigated the common aspects of different abusive language detection tasks (Waseem et al., 2017;	0

695	27914	27914	S20-12	Introduction	7	13	1.0	1.0	Eval-2019 used the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), which contains over 14,000 English tweets annotated using a hierarchical three-level annotation schema that takes both the target and the type of offensive content into account (Zampieri et al., 2019a).	0
696	27915	27915	S20-12	Introduction	8	14	1.0	1.0	The assumption behind this annotation schema is that the target of offensive messages is an important variable that allows us to discriminate between, e.g., hate speech, which often consists of insults targeted toward a group, and cyberbullying, which typically targets individuals.	0
697	27916	27916	S20-12	Introduction	9	15	1.0	1.0	A number of recently organized related shared tasks followed similar hierarchical models.	0

791	31209	31209	W18-3601	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	We report results from the SR'18 Shared Task, a new multilingual surface realisation task organised as part of the ACL'18 Workshop on Multilingual Surface Realisation.	0
792	31210	31210	W18-3601	abstract	2	3	2.0	1.0	As in its English-only predecessor task SR'11, the shared task comprised two tracks with different levels of complexity: (a) a shallow track where the inputs were full UD structures with word order information removed and tokens lemmatised; and (b) a deep track where additionally, functional words and morphological information were removed.	0
793	31211	31211	W18-3601	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The shallow track was offered in ten, and the deep track in three languages.	0
794	31212	31212	W18-3601	abstract	4	5	3.0	1.0	Systems were evaluated (a) automatically, using a range of intrinsic metrics, and (b) by human judges in terms of readability and meaning similarity.	0
795	31213	31213	W18-3601	abstract	5	6	4.0	1.0	This report presents the evaluation results, along with descriptions of the SR'18 tracks, data and evaluation methods.	0

797	31390	31390	W18-3601	Conclusion	1	183	1.0	4.0	SR'18 was the second surface realisation shared task, and followed an earlier pilot task for English, SR'11.	0
798	31391	31391	W18-3601	Conclusion	2	184	2.0	4.0	Participation was high for a first instance   of a shared task, at least in the Shallow Track, indicating that interest is high enough to continue running it again next year to enable more teams to participate.	0
799	31392	31392	W18-3601	Conclusion	3	185	2.0	4.0	One important question that needs to be addressed is to what extent UDs are suitable inputs for NLG systems.	0
800	31393	31393	W18-3601	Conclusion	4	186	3.0	4.0	More specifically, can they reasonably be expected to be generated by other, content-determining, modules in an NLG system, do they provide all the information necessary to generate surface realisations, and if not, how can they be augmented to provide it.	0
801	31394	31394	W18-3601	Conclusion	5	187	3.0	4.0	We hope to discuss these and related issues with the research community as we prepare the next instance of the SR Task.	0
802	31395	31395	W18-3601	Conclusion	6	188	4.0	4.0	A goal to aim for may be to make it possible for different NLG components to be connected via standard interface representations, to increase re-usability for NLG components.	0
803	31396	31396	W18-3601	Conclusion	7	189	4.0	4.0	However, what may constitute a good interface representation for surface realisation remains far from clear.	0

809	31520	31520	W19-3203	abstract	4	6	2.0	1.0	Task 1 asked participants to distinguish tweets reporting an adverse drug reaction (ADR) from those that do not.	1
810	31521	31521	W19-3203	abstract	5	7	3.0	1.0	Task 2, a follow-up to Task 1, asked participants to identify the span of text in tweets reporting ADRs.	1
811	31522	31522	W19-3203	abstract	6	8	3.0	1.0	Task 3 is an end-to-end task where the goal was to first detect tweets mentioning an ADR and then map the extracted colloquial mentions of ADRs in the tweets to their corresponding standard concept IDs in the MedDRA vocabulary.	1
812	31523	31523	W19-3203	abstract	7	9	4.0	1.0	Finally, Task 4 asked participants to classify whether a tweet contains a personal mention of one's health, a more general discussion of the health issue, or is an unrelated mention.	1
813	31524	31524	W19-3203	abstract	8	10	4.0	1.0	A total of 34 teams from around the world registered and 19 teams from 12 countries submitted a system run.	0
814	31525	31525	W19-3203	abstract	9	11	4.0	1.0	We summarize here the corpora for this challenge which are freely available at https://competitions.codalab. org/competitions/22521, and present an overview of the methods and the results of the competing systems.	0
815	31526	31526	W19-3203	Introduction	1	12	1.0	1.0	The intent of the #SMM4H shared tasks series is to challenge the community with Natural Language Processing tasks for mining relevant data for health monitoring and surveillance in social media.	0
816	31527	31527	W19-3203	Introduction	2	13	1.0	1.0	Such challenges require processing imbalanced, noisy, real-world, and substantially creative language expressions from social media.	0
817	31528	31528	W19-3203	Introduction	3	14	1.0	1.0	The competing systems should be able to deal with many linguistic variations and semantic complexities in the various ways people express medication-related concepts and outcomes.	0
818	31529	31529	W19-3203	Introduction	4	15	1.0	1.0	It has been shown in past research (Liu et al., 2011;	0
819	31530	31530	W19-3203	Introduction	5	16	1.0	1.0	Giuseppe et al., 2017) that automated systems frequently under-perform when exposed to social media text because of the presence of novel/creative phrases, misspellings and frequent use of idiomatic, ambiguous and sarcastic expressions.	0
820	31531	31531	W19-3203	Introduction	6	17	1.0	1.0	The tasks act as a discovery and verification process of what approaches work best for social media data.	0
821	31532	31532	W19-3203	Introduction	7	18	2.0	1.0	As in previous years, our tasks focused on mining health information from Twitter.	0
822	31533	31533	W19-3203	Introduction	8	19	2.0	1.0	This year we challenged the community with two different problems.	0
823	31534	31534	W19-3203	Introduction	9	20	2.0	1.0	The first problem focuses on performing pharmacovigilance from social media data.	0
824	31535	31535	W19-3203	Introduction	10	21	2.0	1.0	It is now well understood that social media data may contain reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and these reports may complement traditional adverse event reporting systems, such as the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS).	0
825	31536	31536	W19-3203	Introduction	11	22	2.0	1.0	However, automatically curating reports from adverse reactions from Twitter requires the application of a series of NLP methods in an end-to-end pipeline .	0
826	31537	31537	W19-3203	Introduction	12	23	2.0	1.0	The first three tasks of this year's challenge represent three key NLP problems in a social media based pharmacovigilance pipeline -(i) automatic classification of ADRs, (ii) extraction of spans of ADRs and (iii) normal-ization of the extracted ADRs to standardized IDs.	0
827	31538	31538	W19-3203	Introduction	13	24	2.0	1.0	The second problem explores the generalizability of predictive models.	0
828	31539	31539	W19-3203	Introduction	14	25	3.0	1.0	In health research using social media, it is often necessary for researchers to build individual classifiers to identify health mentions of a particular disease in a particular context.	0
829	31540	31540	W19-3203	Introduction	15	26	3.0	1.0	Classification models that can generalize to different health contexts would be greatly beneficial to researchers in these fields (e.g., (Payam and Eugene, 2018)), as this would allow researchers to more easily apply existing tools and resources to new problems.	0
830	31541	31541	W19-3203	Introduction	16	27	3.0	1.0	Motivated by these ideas, Task 4 was testing tweet classification methods across diverse health contexts, so the test data included a very different health context than the training data.	0
831	31542	31542	W19-3203	Introduction	17	28	3.0	1.0	This setting measures the ability of tweet classifiers to generalize across health contexts.	0

833	31544	31544	W19-3203	Introduction	19	30	3.0	1.0	We collected posts from Twitter, annotated the data for the four tasks proposed and released the posts to the registered teams.	0
834	31545	31545	W19-3203	Introduction	20	31	3.0	1.0	This year, we conducted the evaluation of all participating systems using Codalab, an open source platform facilitating data science competitions.	0
835	31546	31546	W19-3203	Introduction	21	32	4.0	1.0	The performances of the systems were compared on a blind evaluations sets for each task.	0

837	31548	31548	W19-3203	Introduction	23	34	4.0	2.0	We provided the participants with two sets of data for each task, a training and a test set.	0
838	31549	31549	W19-3203	Introduction	24	35	4.0	2.0	Participants had a period of six weeks, from March 5 th to April 15 th , for training their systems on our training sets, and 4 days, from the 16 th to 20 th of April, for calibrating their systems on our test sets and submitting their predictions.	0
839	31550	31550	W19-3203	Introduction	25	36	4.0	2.0	In total 34 teams registered and 19 teams submitted at least one run (each team was allowed to submit, at most, three runs per task).	0
840	31551	31551	W19-3203	Introduction	26	37	4.0	2.0	In detail, we received 43 runs for task 1, 24 for task 2, 10 for task 3 and 15 for task 4.	0
841	31552	31552	W19-3203	Introduction	27	38	4.0	2.0	We briefly describe each task and their data in section 2, before discussing the results obtained in section 3.	0
842	31639	31639	W19-3203	Conclusion	1	125	1.0	4.0	In this paper we presented an overview of the results of #SMM4H 2019 which focuses on a) the resolution of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentioned in Twitter and b) the distinction between tweets reporting personal health status form opinions across different health domains.	0
843	31640	31640	W19-3203	Conclusion	2	126	2.0	4.0	With a total of 92 runs submitted by 19 teams, the challenge was well attended.	0
844	31641	31641	W19-3203	Conclusion	3	127	2.0	4.0	The participants, in large part, opted for neural architectures and integrated pretrained word-embedding sensitive to their contexts based on the recent Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.	0
845	31642	31642	W19-3203	Conclusion	4	128	3.0	4.0	Such architectures were the most efficient on our four tasks.	0
846	31643	31643	W19-3203	Conclusion	5	129	4.0	4.0	Results on tasks 1-3 show that, despite a continuous improvement of performances in the detection of tweets mentioning ADRs over the past years, their end-to-end resolution still remain a major challenge for the community and an opportunity for further research.	0
847	31644	31644	W19-3203	Conclusion	6	130	4.0	4.0	Results of task 4 were more encouraging, with systems able to generalized their predictions over domains not present in their training data.	0

850	32734	32734	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	Most systems, however, are developed using data from just one language such as English.	0
851	32735	32735	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	The SIG-MORPHON 2020 shared task on morphological reinflection aims to investigate systems' ability to generalize across typologically distinct languages, many of which are low resource.	0
852	32736	32736	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	Systems were developed using data from 45 languages and just 5 language families, fine-tuned with data from an additional 45 languages and 10 language families (13 in total), and evaluated on all 90 languages.	0
853	32737	32737	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	A total of 22 systems (19 neural) from 10 teams were submitted to the task.	0
854	32738	32738	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	All four winning systems were neural (two monolingual transformers and two massively multilingual RNNbased models with gated attention).	0
855	32739	32739	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	7	8	4.0	1.0	Most teams demonstrate utility of data hallucination and augmentation, ensembles, and multilingual training for low-resource languages.	0
856	32740	32740	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	8	9	4.0	1.0	Nonneural learners and manually designed grammars showed competitive and even superior performance on some languages (such as Ingrian, Tajik, Tagalog, Zarma, Lingala), especially with very limited data.	0
857	32741	32741	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	abstract	9	10	4.0	1.0	Some language families (Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Congo, Turkic) were relatively easy for most systems and achieved over 90% mean accuracy while others were more challenging.	0
858	32742	32742	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	1	11	1.0	1.0	Human language is marked by considerable diversity around the world.	0
859	32743	32743	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	2	12	1.0	1.0	Though the world's languages share many basic attributes (e.g., Swadesh, 1950 and more recently, List et al., 2016), grammatical features, and even abstract implications (proposed in Greenberg, 1963), each language nevertheless has a unique evolutionary trajectory that is affected by geographic, social, cultural, and other factors.	0
860	32744	32744	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	3	13	1.0	1.0	As a result, the surface form of languages varies substantially.	0
861	32745	32745	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	4	14	1.0	1.0	The morphology of languages can differ in many ways:	0
862	32746	32746	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	5	15	1.0	1.0	"Some exhibit rich grammatical case systems (e.g., 12 in Erzya and 24 in Veps) and mark possessiveness, others might have complex verbal morphology (e.g., Oto-Manguean languages; Palancar and Léonard, 2016) or even ""decline"" nouns for tense (e.g., Tupi-Guarani languages)."	0
863	32747	32747	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	6	16	1.0	1.0	Linguistic typology is the discipline that studies these variations by means of a systematic comparison of languages (Croft, 2002;	0
864	32748	32748	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	7	17	1.0	1.0	Comrie, 1989).	0
865	32749	32749	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	8	18	1.0	1.0	Typologists have defined several dimensions of morphological variation to classify and quantify the degree of crosslinguistic variation.	0
866	32750	32750	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	9	19	2.0	1.0	This comparison can be challenging as the categories are based on studies of known languages and are progressively refined with documentation of new languages (Haspelmath, 2007).	0
867	32751	32751	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	10	20	2.0	1.0	Nevertheless, to understand the potential range of morphological variation, we take a closer look at three dimensions here: fusion, inflectional synthesis, and position of case affixes (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013).	0
868	32752	32752	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	11	21	2.0	1.0	Fusion, our first dimension of variation, refers to the degree to which morphemes bind to one another in a phonological word (Bickel and Nichols, 2013b).	0
869	32753	32753	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	12	22	2.0	1.0	Languages range from strictly isolating (i.e., each morpheme is its own phonological word) to concatenative (i.e., morphemes bind together within a phonological word); nonlinearities such as ablaut or tonal morphology can also be present.	0
870	32754	32754	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	13	23	2.0	1.0	From a geographic perspective, isolating languages are found in the Sahel Belt in West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific.	0

874	32758	32758	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	17	27	3.0	1.0	Inflectional synthesis, the second dimension considered, refers to whether grammatical categories like tense, voice or agreement are expressed as affixes (synthetic) or individual words (analytic) (Bickel and Nichols, 2013c).	0
875	32759	32759	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	18	28	3.0	1.0	Analytic expressions are common in Eurasia (except the Pacific Rim, and the Himalaya and Caucasus mountain ranges), whereas synthetic expressions are used to a high degree in the Americas.	0
876	32760	32760	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	19	29	3.0	1.0	Finally, affixes can variably surface as prefixes, suffixes, infixes, or circumfixes (Dryer, 2013).	0
877	32761	32761	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	20	30	3.0	1.0	Most Eurasian and Australian languages strongly favor suffixation, and the same holds true, but to a lesser extent, for South American and New Guinean languages (Dryer, 2013).	0
878	32762	32762	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	21	31	3.0	1.0	In Mesoamerican languages and African languages spoken below the Sahara, prefixation is dominant instead.	0
879	32763	32763	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	22	32	3.0	1.0	These are just three dimensions of variation in morphology, and the cross-linguistic variation is already considerable.	0
880	32764	32764	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	23	33	3.0	1.0	Such cross-lingual variation makes the development of natural language processing (NLP) applications challenging.	0

883	32767	32767	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	26	36	4.0	1.0	The most commonly used language for developing NLP applications is English.	0
884	32768	32768	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	27	37	4.0	1.0	Along the above dimensions, English is productively concatenative, a mixture of analytic and synthetic, and largely suffixing in its inflectional morphology.	0
885	32769	32769	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	28	38	4.0	1.0	With respect to languages that exhibit inflectional morphology, English is relatively impoverished.	0
886	32770	32770	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	29	39	4.0	1.0	1 Importantly, English is just one morphological system among many.	0

888	32772	32772	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	31	41	4.0	1.0	If an NLP system is trained on just one language, it could be missing important flexibility in its ability to account for cross-linguistic morphological variation.	0
889	32773	32773	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Introduction	32	42	4.0	1.0	In this year's iteration of the SIGMORPHON shared task on morphological reinflection, we specifically focus on typological diversity and aim to investigate systems' ability to generalize across typologically distinct languages many of which are low-resource.	0

894	32778	32778	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	4	47	2.0	1.0	Unlike the task from earlier years, this year's task proceeds in three phases: a Development Phase, a Generalization Phase, and an Evaluation Phase, in which each phase introduces previously unseen data.	0
895	32779	32779	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	5	48	2.0	1.0	The task starts with the Development Phase, which was an elongated period of time (about two months), during which participants develop a model of morphological inflection.	0
896	32780	32780	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	6	49	2.0	1.0	In this phase, we provide training and development splits for 45 languages representing the Austronesian, Niger-Congo, Oto-Manguean, Uralic and Indo-European language families.	0
897	32781	32781	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	7	50	2.0	1.0	Table 1 provides details on the languages.	0
898	32782	32782	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	8	51	3.0	1.0	The Generalization Phase is a short period of time (it started about a week before the Evaluation Phase) during which participants fine-tune their models on new data.	0
899	32783	32783	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	9	52	3.0	1.0	At the start of the phase, we provide training and development splits for 45 new languages where approximately half are genetically related (belong to the same family) and half are genetically unrelated (are isolates or belong to a different family) to the languages presented in the Development Phase.	0
900	32784	32784	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	10	53	3.0	1.0	More specifically, we introduce (surprise) languages from Afro-Asiatic, Algic, Dravidian, Indo-European, Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan, Siouan, Songhay, Southern Daly, Tungusic, Turkic, Uralic, and Uto-Aztecan families.	0
901	32785	32785	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	11	54	3.0	1.0	See Table 2 for more details.	0
902	32786	32786	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	12	55	4.0	1.0	Finally, test splits for all 90 languages are released in the Evaluation Phase.	0
903	32787	32787	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	13	56	4.0	1.0	During this phase, the models are evaluated on held-out forms.	0
904	32788	32788	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	14	57	4.0	1.0	Importantly, the languages from both previous phases are evaluated simultaneously.	0
905	32789	32789	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Task Description	15	58	4.0	1.0	This way, we evaluate the extent to which models (especially those with shared parameters) overfit to the development data: a model based on the morphological patterning of the Indo-European languages may end up with a bias towards suffixing and will struggle to learn prefixing or infixation.	0
906	33088	33088	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	1	357	1.0	4.0	This years's shared task on morphological reinflection focused on building models that could generalize across an extremely typologically diverse set of languages, many from understudied language families and with limited available text resources.	0
907	33089	33089	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	2	358	1.0	4.0	As in previous years, neural models performed well, even in relatively low-resource cases.	0
908	33090	33090	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	3	359	2.0	4.0	Submissions were able to make productive use of multilingual training to take advantage of commonalities across languages in the dataset.	0
909	33091	33091	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	4	360	2.0	4.0	Data augmentation techniques such as hallucination helped fill in the gaps and allowed networks to generalize to unseen inputs.	0
910	33092	33092	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	5	361	2.0	4.0	These techniques, combined with architecture tweaks like sparsemax, resulted in excellent overall performance on many languages (over 90% accuracy on average).	0
911	33093	33093	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	6	362	3.0	4.0	However, the task's focus on typological diversity revealed that some morphology types and language families (Tungusic, Oto-Manguean, South-ern Daly) remain a challenge for even the best systems.	0
912	33094	33094	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	7	363	3.0	4.0	These families are extremely low-resource, represented in this dataset by few or a single language.	0
913	33095	33095	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	8	364	3.0	4.0	This makes cross-linguistic transfer of similarities by multilanguage training less viable.	0
914	33096	33096	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	9	365	4.0	4.0	They may also have morphological properties and rules (e.g., Evenki is agglutinating with many possible forms for each lemma) that are particularly difficult for machine learners to induce automatically from sparse data.	0
915	33097	33097	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	10	366	4.0	4.0	For some languages (Ingrian, Tajik, Tagalog, Zarma, and Lingala), optimal performance was only achieved in this shared task by hand-encoding linguist knowledge in finite state grammars.	0
916	33098	33098	2020.sigmorphon-1.1	Conclusion	11	367	4.0	4.0	It is up to future research to imbue models with the right kinds of linguistic inductive biases to overcome these challenges.	0

918	38130	38130	K15-2001	abstract	1	2	1.0	1.0	The CoNLL-2015 Shared Task is on Shallow Discourse Parsing, a task focusing on identifying individual discourse relations that are present in a natural language text.	0
919	38131	38131	K15-2001	abstract	2	3	1.0	1.0	A discourse relation can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, and takes two arguments realized as sentences, clauses, or in some rare cases, phrases.	0
920	38132	38132	K15-2001	abstract	3	4	2.0	1.0	Sixteen teams from three continents participated in this task.	0
921	38133	38133	K15-2001	abstract	4	5	2.0	1.0	For the first time in the history of the CoNLL shared tasks, participating teams, instead of running their systems on the test set and submitting the output, were asked to deploy their systems on a remote virtual machine and use a web-based evaluation platform to run their systems on the test set.	0
922	38134	38134	K15-2001	abstract	5	6	3.0	1.0	This meant they were unable to actually see the data set, thus preserving its integrity and ensuring its replicability.	0
923	38135	38135	K15-2001	abstract	6	7	3.0	1.0	In this paper, we present the task definition, the training and test sets, and the evaluation protocol and metric used during this shared task.	0

927	38139	38139	K15-2001	Introduction	2	11	1.0	1.0	In the course of the sixteen CoNLL shared tasks organized over the past two decades, progressing gradually to tackle phenomena at the word and phrase level phenomena and then the sentence and extra-sentential level, it was only very recently that discourse level processing has been addressed, with coreference resolution (Pradhan et al., 2011;Pradhan et al., 2012).	0
928	38140	38140	K15-2001	Introduction	3	12	1.0	1.0	The 2015 shared task takes the community a step further in that direction, with the potential to impact scores of richer language applications (Webber et al., 2012).	0
929	38141	38141	K15-2001	Introduction	4	13	1.0	1.0	Given an English newswire text as input, the goal of the shared task is to detect and categorize discourse relations between discourse segments in the text.	0
930	38142	38142	K15-2001	Introduction	5	14	1.0	1.0	Just as there are different grammatical formalisms and representation frameworks in syntactic parsing, there are also different conceptions of the discourse structure of a text, and data sets annotated following these different theoretical frameworks (Stede, 2012;	0
931	38143	38143	K15-2001	Introduction	6	15	1.0	1.0	Webber et al., 2012;Prasad and Bunt, 2015).	0
932	38144	38144	K15-2001	Introduction	7	16	1.0	1.0	For example, the RST-DT Corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) is based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory of Mann and Thompson (1988) and produces a complete treestructured RST analysis of a text, whereas the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008;	0
933	38145	38145	K15-2001	Introduction	8	17	1.0	1.0	Prasad et al., 2014) provides a shallow representation of discourse structure, in that each discourse relation is annotated independently of other discourse relations, leaving room for a high-level analysis that may attempt to connect them.	0
934	38146	38146	K15-2001	Introduction	9	18	1.0	1.0	For the CoNLL-2015 shared task, we chose to use the PDTB, as it is currently the largest data set annotated with discourse relations.	0

964	38176	38176	K15-2001	Task Definition	2	48	1.0	1.0	Specifically, given a newswire article as input, a participating system is asked to return a set of discourse relations contained in the text.	1
965	38177	38177	K15-2001	Task Definition	3	49	2.0	1.0	A discourse relation, as defined in the PDTB, from which the training data for the shared task is drawn, is a relation taking two abstract objects (events, states, facts, or propositions) as arguments.	1
966	38178	38178	K15-2001	Task Definition	4	50	2.0	1.0	Discourse relations may be expressed with explicit connectives like because, however, but, or implicitly inferred between abstract object units.	0

1046	42963	42963	D19-6007	Introduction	1	6	1.0	1.0	Due to the rise of powerful pre-trained word and sentence representations, automated text processing has come a long way in recent years, with systems that perform even better than humans on some datasets (Rajpurkar et al., 2016a).	0
1047	42964	42964	D19-6007	Introduction	2	7	1.0	1.0	However, natural language understanding also involves complex challenges.	0
1048	42965	42965	D19-6007	Introduction	3	8	1.0	1.0	One important difference between human and machine text understanding lies in the fact that humans can access commonsense knowledge while processing text, which helps them to draw inferences about facts that are not mentioned in a text, but that are assumed to be common ground.	0

1057	42974	42974	D19-6007	Introduction	12	17	3.0	1.0	The tasks aim to evaluate the commonsense inference capabilities of text understanding systems in two settings: Commonsense inference in everyday narrations (task 1) and commonsense inference in news texts (task 2).	1
1058	42975	42975	D19-6007	Introduction	13	18	3.0	1.0	Framed as machine comprehension evaluations, the datasets used for both tasks contain challenging reading comprehension questions asking for facts that are not explicitly mentioned in the given reading texts.	0

1062	42979	42979	D19-6007	Introduction	17	22	4.0	1.0	Still, there are cases that remain elusive: Humans outperform this system by a margin of 7% (task 1) and 8% (task 2).	0
1063	42980	42980	D19-6007	Introduction	18	23	4.0	1.0	Our results indicate that while Transformer models are able to perform extremely well on the data used in our shared task, there are still some remaining cases demonstrating that human level is not achieved yet.	0
1064	42981	42981	D19-6007	Introduction	19	24	4.0	1.0	Still, we believe that our results also imply the need for more challenging data sets.	0
1065	42982	42982	D19-6007	Introduction	20	25	4.0	1.0	In particular, we need data sets that make it harder to benefit from redundancy in the training data or large-scale pretraining on similar domains.	0
